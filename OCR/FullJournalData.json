    "3": "\u201cPresident's Messages\n\nIn January, 1950, a small group of numismatists, then associated as\nthe Ottawa Coin Club, decided to attempt to found a national\norganization of those interested in collecting coins, tokens, medals, and\npaper money, under the title of the Canadian Numismatic Association.\nThe venture met a considerable measure of success from the start, and\ntoday, with an active membership list that approaches the 700 mark, may\n\nbe considered as resting on a firm basis.\n\nFrom the beginning, one of our goals was the publication of a printed\nmagazine, and this goal has been realized with the appearance of this\ninitial issue of the Canadian Numismatic Journal. Publication is, of\ncourse, in itself something of a venture, and will depend for its success\non the continuing support of an adequate membership, and \u2014 fully as\n\nimportant \u2014 of an adequate supply of contributions to fill the pages.\n\nThat the goal of a printed publication has been reached at all is due,\nin large measure, to the untiring efforts of the Association\u2019s officers over\nthe past six years, and to the loyal support of a hard core of members who\nhave stayed with the ship since it was first launched. It seems fitting at\nthis time to express our gratitude to both groups. Given such support in\nthe years to come, the future of the Canadian Numismatic Journal is\n\nassured.\n\nG. R. L. Porter,\n\nPresident.\n",

Bulletin \u2014 starts the seventh year of publication,\nthus putting a period to six full years of its history.\n\nMuch of the credit for the success of the C.N.A. and its monthly\nBulletin goes to our President, G. R. L. Potter. It was he who, in 1950,\nwhen the Ottawa Coin Club formed the Canadian Numismatic Associa-\ntion, assumed the duties of Editor and issued the first number of the\nmimeographed Bulletin. Now, six years later, another big step is being\ntaken by replacing the Bulletin with a printed Journal, under the\npresidency of Mr. Potter.\n\nThe officers and all others responsible for the Association\u2019s\npublication want to thank their many friends who have so kindly expressed\ntheir best wishes for our new venture. Such sentiments make each feel\nthat it is worth while after all, and impel one to join with Tiny Tim in\nsaying \u201cGod Bless Us Every One\u201d. How can we lose with such support?\n\nThe advertisers have been among our best \u201cwell-wishers\u201d, having not\nonly expressed their pleasure at the suddenly announced change of\npublication, but actually, in some cases, increased their advertising\nrequirements in the face of the upwardly revised rates. Accompanying\nthe ads were very flattering messages of congratulation. The governing\nbody of the C.N.A. tenders them a hearty vote of thanks, and in turn\nwishes them and all our members a\n\nHAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence regarding the mint sets\nissued by the Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa, during the last few years.\nThese coins have been of such excellence that they seem to require a\nspecial term to distinguish them from the regular run of the mill\n\u201cancirculated\u201d ones. The sets of coins distributed in Ottawa in 1953 and\nin 1955, and also sold in cardboard holders otherwise, are not classified\nofficially as \u201cproof\u201d by the Mint. But they do resemble \u201cproof\u201d coins in\ntheir superb appearance, so would \u201cproof-like\u201d be a suitable term?\n\nThere has not been an official issue of \u201cproof\u201d Canadian coins since\n1937, yet an occasional mention of a \u201cproof\u201d coin of subsequent years is\nmade in numismatic circles. Should we not abide by the official ruling\nand refer to such coins as \u201cproof-like\u201d or some other name than \u201cproof\u201d?\nThose coins are not \u201cproof\u201d by definition, and we fear that if collectors\nstart making their own rules, the tendency will be to class any uncirculated\ncoin, whether immaculate or not, as a \u201cproof\u201d.\n\nWe invite further correspondence on this subject; all comments and\nexpressions of opinion will be most welcome as this is a point that needs\nclarification.\n\nws Bc\n",

This was one of a series of lectures\non museum appreciation. Several other members of our Club participated\nas a supporting panel to represent various sections of numismatic\nknowledge.\n\nThe main speaker, Mr. Potter, spoke on Japanese swords and their\naccoutrements, dwelling on the exquisite workmanship. Many of the\nscabbards, hilts, guards and other accessories were elaborately engraved\nand worked with precious metals. Some of the component parts were\non display which added much to the members\u2019 appreciation.\n\nJohn J. Pittman exhibited numerous items including many gold\ncoins. One of these was a 5-guinea piece of 1716, the scarcest of the issues\nof George the First; another of the choice items was a sovereign of 1925,\nwhich is very scarce. A set of gold coin weights issued by the Republic\nof Bolivia, dated 31.X.52 were also quite interesting; they bore no\nindication of value. A set of the 1955 coins of Cyprus, from 3 mils to\n100 mils were described and exhibited, as was also a set of 1936 Maundy\nmoney. According to Mr. Pittman, the 1936 Maundy sets, which were\nof course distributed by Edward VIII, are the scarcest of all modern\nMaundy coins.\n\nThe meeting closed on a very harmonious, conversational note which\nwas engaged in by all present.\n\nPeter S.

    "12": "The old Masters can be wrong!\nby Major Sheldon S. Carrott, C.D.\n\nFor so many years the various works -by P. N. Breton and Dr. Joseph\nLeroux have been the standard references for Canadian numismatists\nthat they have come to be regarded as almost infallible. It is true that\nduring the past sixty years new information has come to light that was\nnot known to these early numismatists but it is also true that it is seldom\nthat glaring errors are discovered in their works. One such error has\nrecently come to light in the illustrations by both authors of one of the\ncommonest of the Canadian bank tokens.\n\nThe tip-off in this case came from an auction catalogue issued in\nNovember, 1954 by a well-known dealer. One lot was described as\nfollows: \u201cQuebec Bank Penny Token. 1852. Similar to B-528 which\nshows Britannia seated. However, the whip end in man\u2019s hand hangs\nlonger. The ground he stands on is larger. On reverse Britannia has\nno flag over her head and her hand is outstretched pointing to the ship?\nThis reverse is similar to the half penny, in which her hand is outstretched,\nbut half penny has the flag, whereas this doesn\u2019t. Fine.\u201d\n\nWe needn\u2019t concern ourselves with the points about the whip end\nbeing longer and the ground being larger. There are many varieties of\nthe habitant pennies and halfpennies in which the whip-lash is of varying\nlengths and in which the ground may be large or small. Neither need\nwe worry too much as to whether there is a flag on the rock over\nBritannia\u2019s head. It will be noted that the specimen described above\nwas in only Fine condition. An examination of a number of Fine\nspecimens will show that the flag is very faint or entirely worn off. On\nVery Fine or better specimens the flag shows clearly on both pennies and\nhalfpennies. \u2018The part of the description of real interest, however, is \u201cher\nhand is outstretched pointing to the ship? This reverse is similar to the\nhalfpenny, in which her hand is outstretched\u201d. It is not surprising that\nthe cataloguer was mislead.\n\nNow, have a look in your copy of Breton, 1894 at the illustrations of\nNos. 528 and 529, the Quebec Bank 1852 penny and halfpenny. The\nillustrations show Britannia with her left hand by her side on the penny\nbut outstretched toward the ship on the halfpenny. Next, take a look in\nyour copy of Leroux (1888) at the illustrations of Nos. 532 and 533. The\nillustrations are almost identical with those in Breton. Finally, have a\nlook at the Quebec Bank 1852 penny and halfpenny in your own\ncollection and you will find that on the reverses of both the penny and\nhalfpenny, Britannia\u2019s left arm points toward the ship! \u2018There is no\ndoubt about it that the illustrations of the reverse of the penny is\n\n\u2014 i \u2014\n",
    "13": "incorrect in both Breton and Leroux. Britannia\u2019s left arm on the penny\nshould point toward the ship but it doesn\u2019t.\n\nNot only did these illustrious gentlemen make the mistake once \u2014\nthey made it several times. The error was made first by Dr. Leroux in\nhis 1888 work. Oddly enough he had an accurate illustration in his 1883\nbook. Breton made the error first in his 1890 book and repeated it in 1894,\n1896 and 1912. On the other hand R. W. McLachlan produced an\naccurate illustration in his 1903 work, as did Dr. Courteau in his 1927\nbook and Scotts in their 1913 catalogue.\n\nNumismatists are noted for discovering the slightest error in coins,\nmedals and tokens. It is odd that this error in an illustration in widely\nused numismatic reference works has escaped notice for so long.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBreton, P. N.\u2014 Canadian Coin Collector, 1890.

    "14": "Metallurgical Aspects of Coinage\nwith Special Reference to Mickel\nAddress delivered to the Toronto Coin Club, on March 26, 1955,\nby Aubrey A. Turrte,\n\nMechanical Engineer, The International Nickel Company of Canada\n\nIn my work, I am concerned\nwith properties and fabrication of\nnickel, nickel alloys, and competi-\ntive materials. I will, therefore,\nconfine my remarks in the main to\nmetallurgical aspects as they con-\ncern the government which must\nprovide the raw materials of coin-\nage, the Mint which manufactures\nthe coins, and the people that must\nuse the coins. Some historical\ncomment is included, and a refer-\nence to \u201cour Company\u201d.\n\nIn speaking of \u201cour Company\u201d I\nuse the expression in its broadest\nsense. First, because nickel has a\nspecial significance to all Canadians\ndue to its abundance here and its\nrole in the Canadian economy, I\nbelieve we are justified in thinking\nof it as a distinctively Canadian\nmetal. Secondly, ownership in the\ncompany is widely distributed, and\nit is quite likely that some of you\nare among its shareholders.\n\nOur company supplies approxi-\nmately 70% of the nearly four\nhundred million pounds annually\navailable to the markets of the free\nworld. Of this amount, only three\nto four per cent goes into coinage.\nThis does not seem like a very\nsubstantial amount of nickel. How-\never, when it is remembered that\nthe weight. of coins is usually\nmeasured in either grains or grams,\n\nthe amount runs into astronomical\nfigures.\n\nFor example, if 4% of our\nCompany\u2019s production were confin-\ned to the Canadian 5 cent piece,\nit would produce one billion\n\u201cNickels\u201d. If consumed in the\nproduction of the U.S. 5 cent piece,\nwhich contains 25% nickel, balance\ncopper, four billion \u201cNickels\u201d could\nbe minted. Over the years, the\nallocation to coinage has grown and\nwill undoubtedly do so in the\nfuture.\n\nFeely reports, and I quote \u201cIn\nthe United Kingdom the withdraw-\nal from circulation of more than\ntwo billion quarternary silver coins\nand their replacement with cupro-\nnickel coins of the same denomina-\ntions will take approximately twenty\nyears to accomplish and it is\nestimated that the saving on the\noperation will exceed \u00a330,000,000\nat the present prices of the metals\ninvolved. Over 27,000,000 fine\nounces of silver were recovered in\n1949 from the coins withdrawn\nfrom circulation.\n\nIndia adopted pure nickel as the\nbasis of her coinage system in 1946.\nUp to 1949, together with Pakistan\nand Hyderabad, she has imported\nover seven thousand metric tons of\nnickel in the form of blanks which\nhave been struck by the Bombay\n\n\u2014t\n",
    "15": "and Calcutta Mints. The Ministry\nof Finance announced in April \u201949\nthat the Indian Government is\nbuilding a refinery for the recovery\nof three hundred million ounces of\nsilver contained in the quarternary\nsilver coins of India and Pakistan\nnow being replaced by pure nickel.\nThe 1950 issue of pure nickel\nIndian coins in three denominations\ncarried the inscription \u201cGovernment\nof India\u201d for the first time.\n\nThe Government of Burma\nannounced the adoption of pure\nnickel for the one-half and one-\nquarter Rupee coins, leaving for\nlater consideration the issuance of\none Rupee coins. These new\nBurmese coins are unusually attrac-\ntive in appearance and remarkable\nfor their perfection of design and\ndetail.\n\nLet us consider why nickel has\nreplaced much of the traditional\ngold and silver used in coinage.\nThe reasons are both metallurgical\nand monetaty.\n\nMetallurgically speaking, nickel\nhas no equal in its combination of\nproperties which makes for ease of\ncoinability, durability, good appear-\nance, and difficulty experienced in\nattempting to counterfeit. It is also\nmagnetic, unlike all of the other\ncoins with the exception of steel\nsubstitutes. Its magnetism is used\nto advantage in singling it out from\nother coins, or for use in certain\ntypes of vending machines.\n\n1 Since 1951 India, Pakistan, and\nBurma, because of the scarcity of nickel,\nhad to discontinue the use of pure nickel\nand are using cupro-nickel at present.\n\nThe Swiss actually attempted to\nmint a pure nickel coin back in the\n1850's, but owing to the presence of\nimpurities it was brittle and lacked\nmalleability. It was therefore aban-\ndoned, and a nickel-copper substi-\ntute used until in 1881 the first\npure nickel coin was issued. This\ncoin had to await the development\nof malleable nickel, which was made\npossible by a discovery of Joseph\nWharton of Philadelphia, in 1865.\n(Wharton patented a magnesium\ntreatment which took care of traces\nof sulphur in nickel and _ thus\nremoved the embrittling element.)\n\nFollowing 1859, when a Belgium\nMonetary Commission effectually\nassailed the then prevailing theory\nthat the intrinsic value of coinage\nmust approximate its nominal value,\nnickel and nickel alloyed copper\nappeared best suited for token\ncoinage. Surprisingly enough, the\nfirst pure nickels which were circu-\nlated in Switzerland in 1881 did\nhave an intrinsic value approximat-\ning the coin\u2019s nominal value, but\nsince that date the Canadian mines\nhave come into production and the\nprice of nickel today is but a frac-\ntion of the price at that time.\n\nThe first recorded occurrence of\nnickel in coinage was in a Bactrian\ncoin issued in the reign of King\nEuthydemus II, in approximately\n235 B.C. It was found to contain\nabout 20% nickel with most of the\nbalance being copper. The coin,\nconsidered to be a single metal, may\nhave been a natural alloy.\n\n(To be continued)\n\n+ \u2014\n",

    "28": "arly Greek Coins\n\nOuiline of a talk given by A. E. H. Petrie on January 9, 1956,\nto C.N.A. Chapter #\u00a31 of Ottawa\n\nCoins had their origin in the need for a convenient, dependable\nmedium of exchange in return for goods and services, starting with the\nexpansion of mercantile imperialism among the Greek city-states around\nthe Aegean Sea about 700 B.C. This was made possible by the establish-\nment of safer trading conditions under the protection of strong rulers\nfollowing several centuries of upheaval and brigandage. Standardized\ncoinage was not so much a result of any decisions made by those autocrats,\nas a development accompanying the first fowering of a democratic way\nof life among the ancient Greek peoples. In other words, it arose from\nthe needs of their merchant traders for handy, reliable units of exchange\nfor goods or services; these units took the form of flattened pieces of gold\nor silver, rounded or oval in shape, the flans used having a definite size,\nweight and purity of metal; they were struck with the seal of the authority\nissuing them, which could be expected to support their current exchange\nvalue, \u2014 at least, in the home market. Copper coins, for small change,\ndid not come into general use until the latter part of the fifth century B.C.,\nand then only because of state bankruptcy, as was the case with Athens\nafter the Peloponnesian War.\n\nOnce established, the obvious merit of standard coinage for large-scale\ntrade and commerce \u2014 particularly by contrast to the uncertainties of the\nold barter system, or of dealing in more or less pure bullion \u2014 resulted in\nthe adoption of coins as the prime medium of exchange throughout the\ncivilized world. Indeed, the purest gold and silver coins were eagerly\nsought by the more barbarous countries beyond the imperial frontiers of\nGreece and Rome, for savage tribesmen were not slow to appreciate their\nimportance as a dependable means of satisfying their own needs and\nwants. \u2018This is proved by the numerous hoards of Greek and Roman\nspecie found in northern Europe, and as far afield as Siberia, eastern\nIndia, and even in Indo-China. One might add that it is now pretty\ngenerally accepted that one of the main reasons for the economic decline\nof the Roman Empire, after the exhaustion of her best manpower, is to\nbe found in the steady drain of her gold and silver resources to India in\nreturn for Chinese silks and oriental spices. To give some idea of trade\nramifications across Europe and Asia as early as the fifth century B.C.,\nChinese Chou Dynasty bronze vessels of that period have come to light\nin contemporary tombs near Rome, and at Canterbury in England.\nSimilarly, early Mohammedan silver coins minted at Tashkent in Central\nAsia about A.D. 900 were greatly admired for their size and purity by\nthe Vikings and Danes of that day, so that many of these Arab coins have\nbeen found in Danish, Swedish and Norwegian burials of 1000 years ago.\n\n\u201422\u2014\n",
    "29": "All this tends to prove that, since the invention of coins in the\neighth century B.C., an enormous amount of human history, \u2014 including\ntrade and commerce, economics and politics, public finance and state\nbankruptcy, the rise and fall of dynasties and empires (some practically\nunknown, but for their coins), religious faith and propaganda, art and\ndesign of every kind, \u2014 all these aspects of our history, and many others \u2014\nhave left their enduring mark and memorial upon myriads of coins. The\nmore old hoards are studied in relation to the sites where they were\nfound, and such information as we may have on their time and place of\norigin, the more we learn of human developments, including our own\norigins, over these last 3000 years. Although this is little known or\nunderstood, the scientific study of coins, or \u201cnumismatics\u201d, as we call it,\nshould be and is one of the principal pillars of scientific history. The\nothers are: archaeology (the scientific excavation of historic sites);\nsecondly, the study of records and written histories that have come down\nto us; and finally, and most recently, the classification of pottery sherds\nor fragments in relation to their time and place of production. For\naccurate dating of historic sites, pottery can now take us back many\nthousands of years, but as said before, an enormous wealth of accurate\ndata can be derived from the careful and comprehensive study of coins\nsince their invention about 700 B.C. in Asia Minor and the islands of the\nAegean Sea.\n\n_ To appreciate the value of coins in terms of living history, we must\nbe able to understand the meaning of the designs and inscriptions upon\nthem. For instance, on the basis of design and palaeographical evidence,\nthe earliest-known inscribed coin is believed to have been struck at\nEphesus in Asia Minor about 690 B.C. It is the shape and size of a\nkidney-bean, with a grazing stag shown on the obverse and an incuse\nmark, from the stamping punch used, on the reverse. Above the stag, in\nGreek, are the words \u201cI am the sign of the Bright One\u201d, \u2014 that is to say,\nof the Ephesian Diana, who had the stag as one of her symbols. To the\nshrine of this Asiatic mother goddess \u2014 still great and famous in the days\nof St. Paul, 750 years later, \u2014 we would appear to owe our earliest inscribed\ncoin, and it is unique.\n\nOnce a particular design became associated with a coin of generally\naccepted quality, so that it assumed a universal commercial importance,\nthe issuing authority usually found it inadvisable to alter the design or to\ndebase the coin\u2019s metallic content. That is, the reliability of certain coins\nassociated with particular designs made them immensely popular through-\nout the Eastern Mediterranean countries, and beyond. Such was the\ncase, over a period of several centuries, with the silver staters of Aegina, a\nGreek island not far from Athens, which used the local turtle as its\nemblem, from which these coins derived their common name, in Greek,\nof \u201cturtles\u201d. The earliest \u201cturtles\u201d are thought to have been the first\ncoins struck in Europe. Likewise, the numerous sizes of Athenian coins\n\noa SE coe\n",

Athenian \u201cowls\u201d struck by the tyrant Peisistratus in 566 B.C.\nseem to be the earliest coins bearing complete obverse and reverse designs,\nas against the punch-marked reverses. In the beginning, heraldic animals\nwere employed for \u201csealing\u201d obverses by nearly all of the Greek city-states\nissuing coins, but before 150 years had passed, these gave way to likenesses\nof local divinities, with symbols and inscriptions. Portraits of reigning\nmonarchs began to appear on Greek coins in the Age of Alexander the\nGreat, about 330 B.C., but then set a standard of beauty in numismatic\nportraiture never since recaptured.\n\nWhile we are speaking of the beauties of Greek coins, perhaps it\nshould be mentioned that during the thousand years of Ancient Greek\ncoin designs, almost every phase in the development of Greek plastic art\nin all regions coming under her influence is represented on the coins.\nWhere Greek painting and sculpture have come down to us in fragmentary\nform, the coins show us every aspect of the Greek creative spirit in this\nmedium from the archaic, through the great fifth century B.C., down to\nthe final merging of late classical art with the early Byzantine, or mediaeval\nGreek style. Representations on coins of the masterpieces of Ancient\nGreek sculpture, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, have enabled\nmodern experts to reconstruct them from their broken and scattered\nfragments.\n\nUnfortunately, while the rarest and finest Greek coins sell for one-\ntenth the price of the rarest postage stamps, they are still too costly for\nall but the comparatively well-to-do to collect on any large scale. Even\nthe copper coins, in V.F. examples, now sell for an average of $5 to $10\napiece. Moreover, intelligent appreciation of but one of the many facets\nof Greek numismatics \u2014 such as the issues of Alexander the Great and\nhis successors \u2014 requires a fair knowledge of ancient history, with. at least\na small library of fairly expensive reference works. For your information,\nthe best one-volume general reference in English on Greek coins is B. V.\nHead\u2019s Historia Numorum, which can still be obtained from England for\nabout $12. The more extensive series of consulting volumes are apt to\nbe much dearer than this, particularly since many of them are out of print.\nI mention these details, not to discourage your interest in a most fascinat-\ning and rewarding hobby, but simply to warn you that fine Greek coins\nare not easy to come by these days, even in the main European markets,\nand that their detailed study usually requires a library of rare and out of\nprint books which may prove to be more valuable than the coins them-\nselves. Perhaps the largest collection of Greek coins in Canada \u2014\nnumbering over 10,000 items \u2014 belongs to Dr. Bernard Wasson of Valois,\nQuebec. But Dr. Wasson\u2019s coins are by no means as valuable as his\nreference library. My personal collection of Greek coins numbers around\n60, including some splendid examples of the best-known issues.

When exposed during such\ndiggings, the coins are invaluable for dating purposes, so that most of\nthem are kept for museums, along with the other objects found. One\nis sorry to add that a majority of hoards are found accidentally by farm\nworkers, labourers and youngsters who carry them off in the secret hope\nof selling them for a fortune. As a result, they are separated from their\nsite of finding without science being able to obtain any record of the\nplace and level whence they came. In some cases, extremely rare and\nvaluable gold coins have been melted down by ignorant persons for the\nintrinsic value of the metal in them, which was insignificant by\ncomparison to the importance of the coins themselves. If you should\never come upon any buried hoards of ancient coins, be sure to let the\nnearest museum authorities know, so that your discovery may not be\nlost for any precious information it may afford on local origins and history.\nNot only are you likely to secure a better financial return on your treasure\ntrove that way, but your moral satisfaction should certainly be greater\nthan would accrue from melting the gold down for bullion!\n\nCe CD\n\nBritannia on the English Coinage\n\n(From Jessie\u2019s England under the Stuarts,\nin the Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal \u2014 1873)\n\nThe passion of Philip Rotier, the medallist for \u201cLa Belle Stewart\u201d is\nwell known.

The\nChinese had previously unearthed\nsome of this ore known as \u201cPei-\ntung\u2019\u00ae and had for centuries\nproduced metallic articles of this\ncomposition which eventually made\ntheir way to the Western World.\nCenturies later in Saxony (Germa-\nny) a_nickel-containing ore was\nlocated which stubbornly resisted\nthe efforts made by miners to\n\n2 Feely reports that the alleged use of\n\na natural alloy in the Bactrian coins is still\na moot question.\n\n3 Feely prefers use of the term \u201cPei-\ntung\u201d (white copper) in describing Chinese\ncupro-nickel to the.

Under the Roman\nEmperors copper was added. Just\nbefore the fall of the Empire it was\n\n4 Feely is currently conducting research\ninto the derivation of the word \u201cnickel\u201d\nas the above explanation is not definitely\nestablished.\n\n\u2014 28 \u2014\n",
    "35": "added to the extent that in some\ncases only 2% of gold was present.\nIn the Middle Ages, this practice\nof debasing alloys was discarded,\nand standards of fineness or purity\nestablished.\n\nEngland adopted the gold stand-\nard of 22 carats (92%) fine in 1526.\nThe Saxons introduced to England\nthe silver standard of 925 fineness\nwhich was not continuously adher-\ned to. In fact, during the reign of\nHenry VIII, his numerous difficul-\nties caused him to debase the silver\ncoinage until it contained only one-\nthird silver, two-thirds copper.\nEdward VI lowered it to one-\nquarter silver. Queen Elizabeth I\nrestored it to the 925 fineness where\nit remained until the inflationary\nperiod following World War I, at\nwhich time it was reduced to 50%.\n\nAlthough many metals other\nthan gold and silver have been\nused over the centuries, most have\nbeen abandoned because of inferior\nproperties. For example, iron was\nwidely circulated in the 5th century\nB.C. and later in World War I\ndays in both Poland and Germany,\nwhere it was used as a substitute\nfor stratetic nickel and copper and\nscarce silver. Pure zinc has been\nused in Czechoslovakia, and before\nthe Christian era lead was used in\nEgypt and later in the 17th century\nin Denmark. Pure tin half-pennies\nand farthings had a limited circula-\ntion in the British Isles prior to\n1692. Even the scarce and highly\nvalued platinum found a place in\ncoinage in Russia a little over a\ncentury ago. Copper and modifica-\ntions of it known as bronze, have,\nof course, been used since the\n\nearliest recorded times. Very\nrecently, certain brasses and alumi-\nnum bronzes have been popular\nsubstitutes and now pure aluminum\ncoins are in circulation in Bulgaria,\nand India is seriously considering\ntheir use.\n\nSince the time of the Belgian\nCommission on Monetary Reform,\ncupro-nickel and a somewhat later\npure nickel were widely adopted as\nreplacements for silver alloys. The\nlow alloy bronzes have, of course,\nheld their position in the lowest\ndenominations because if cupro-\nnickel or copper were used here,\nthe intrinsic value would approxi-\nmate their nominal value.\n\nWhat Determines Choice\nof Alloy?\n\nBasically, the choice of an alloy\nfor coinage is dependent on avail-\nability and properties. The tradi-\ntional coinage of the past, gold,\nsilver, and copper, has in recent\ntimes suffered a decline due to the\nvast increase in the amounts and\ncirculation of coinage and mone-\ntary reforms. Unfavourable trade\nbalances in many countries of the\nworld, with a consequent upset in\ngold reserves, have seen a virtual\ndisappearance of gold as a medium\nof exchange. The silver Rupee,\nwhich for 100 years was looked\nupon in India as \u201cGold\u201d to be\ncherished and occasionally convert-\ned to metal ornaments, gave place\nto pure nickel in 1946.\n\nAluminum bronze replaced silver\nin the French 1 and 2-franc pieces\nfollowing 1921 and similarly in\nother countries of Europe.\n\n+ 19\n",
    "36": "Copper, originally added to de-\nbase or reduce cost of silver\ncoinage, was soon realized to be\nadvantageous, in that it strength-\nened and toughened the alloy so\nthat silver coins, alloyed with\ncopper, outlasted the high purity\ncoins with great savings to the\nState. These more durable coins\nwere also found to be more difficult\nto deface (clip) or counterfeit.\nThis practice of clipping appears\nto have been a popular past time\nespecially during the Medieval era,\nwhen it was indulged in to the\nextent that coins decreased in\nweight and shape more rapidly\nthan could \u2018be attributed to wear.\nThis practice gives rise to our\nmodern, expression \u201cclip joint\u201d.\n\nIn practice, most of the alloys\nthat have been used in coins came\nabout by accident rather than by\na programme of research. In\nFrance, soon after the revolution\nof 1789, copper was scarce, and to\nfill the need of coinage church\nbells were melted down to eke out\nthe supply. It so happened that\nthese church bells were copper\nalloyed with tin, and occasionally\na small amount of zinc; the formu-\nlation of experts in this field in\norder to get clarity and perfection\nof sound. By mixing the bell alloy\nwith existing copper coinage, they\narrived at an alloy of approximately\n95% copper, 4% tin, and 1% zinc,\nwhich had such excellent wearing\nproperties and, I imagine, a decided\nring, that it was adopted by France\nin 1851, and a number of other\ncountries followed France\u2019s lead.\n\nCupro-nickel, an alloy of approxi-\nmately 75% copper and 25% nickel,\n\nhas been popular ever since the\ntime of the Belgian Monetary\nCommission as mentioned above,\nand continues on the increase to\nthe present time. In the United\nStates, the cupro-nickel 5 cent\npiece was temporarily discontinued\nin May, 1942, to conserve both\nnickel and copper. \u2018The Second\nWar Powers\u2019 Act, March, 1942,\nprovided for a U.S. \u201cNickel\u201d con-\ntaining 50% copper and 50% silver\nwith provision to vary the analysis\nin the public interest. After a\nlittle research into the property of\nvarious alloys, having conservation\nin mind, the U.S. Mint came out\nin 1943 with a 5 cent piece contain-\ning 35% silver, 56% copper, and\n9% manganese. This was discon-\ntinued, however, by the end of\n1945. It is interesting to observe\nhow the strategic position of various\nmetals has affected the composition\nof coinage, especially during a\ncrisis. For example, the discon-\ntinuance of the substitute 5 cent\npiece in the United States was\nmade possible by the increase in\nboth nickel and copper towards the\nend of the war.\n\nIn 1943, the United States bronze\ncent was replaced with a zinc-\ncoated cent, which was produced\nthroughout 1943 to the extent of\none billion. In 1944 brass cartridge\ncases became available in sufficient\nquantity to supply the much needed\nbronze so that the original copper\nwas again minted. The U.S. 1 cent\npiece has a composition known as\n\u201ccommercial bronze\u201d, which is 95%\ncopper and 5% zinc. The zinc,\nsomewhat higher than many coun-\ntried use, was due to its occurrence\n\n= 3) =\n",
    "37": "in scrap such as cartridge brass,\nwhich has an alloy 70% copper and\n30% zinc.\n\nIn Canada in 1943, the Tombac\n\u201cnickel\u201d, even more closely resem-\nbled the analysis of cartridge brass.\nIt is now being withdrawn from\ncirculation owing to its confusion\nwith coppers. In 1944 and 1945\nchromium plated steel 5 cent pieces\nwere used as a substitute for pure\nnickel, and later during the Korean\ncrisis in the years 1951, 1952, 1953.\nI read recently, in one of the bulle-\ntins of the Tin Research Institute,\nof efforts to conserve nickel by the\nuse of tin to replace a portion of\n\u2018the nickel in cupro-nickels. It was\nnot possible to reduce nickel below\n25% without some deterioration in\ncolour, unless restored by adding a\nthird element such as tin. After\nsome research, the Council came up\nwith an alloy having 15% nickel,\n5% tin, which although admittedly\na little harder than is desired for\nminting, they considered a suitable\nsubstitute, and by lowering the tin\nto 3% the softness was equal to the\ncupro-nickel coin. The irony of\nthis proposed substitute impressed\nme in particular, since during the\nwar there was a great effort made\nin Ottawa by myself and other\nmembers of the Metals Control, to\nconserve tin. Now, in the view of\nthe Tin Research Council, and as\na result of the recent programme\nof nickel conservation, the tables\nwould appear to be turned within\na period of ten years. However, it\nis our feeling that the long-run\nposition for nickel is definitely more\nsecure than is tin, which is largely\nrecovered from countries bordered\n\nby, and in some cases dominated\nby, Russia. Moreover, the durabil-\nity of nickel and high nickel alloy\ncoins is a fact of everyday observa-\ntion. Copper and bronze coins\nbecome greasy and soiled in circula-\ntion. It has been found that the\ngrease contains fatty acids, which\ncorrode the copper, forming a\nsuperficial, friable crust which is\ncontinuously rubbed off. Thus the\nexcellent corrosion resistance of\nnickel and nickel-copper alloys is a\ndecided advantage in its use.\n\nBy May of last year, the Royal\nCanadian Mint returned to pure\nnickel. Requests to tender for\n10,000,000 nickel blanks were sent\nout at that time, and many of these\nhave been coined into shiny new\n1955 \u201cnickels\u201d and are now in\ncirculation.\n\nMinting\n\nA Mint is defined as a place\nwhere coins are manufactured by\nauthority of the State. Money, in\nthe sense that it means any medium\nof exchange, was used long before\nrecorded history. Even eight\nthousand years ago the Chinese\nhad a form of money, but coins\ndid not appear until approximately\n700 B.C.\n\nThe Ancients soon learned to\nappreciate a metallic medium of\nexchange because at that time it\nmust be remembered that all\nmetals were highly valued and they\npossessed a superior appearance and\ngreater durability than other forms\nof exchange.\n\nSoon simple die marks were used\nto indicate the value or authenticity\n\n\u2014\n",

A wedge-shaped die\nknown as a \u201ccoin\u201d and a hammer\nwas used to mark the blank, thus\nthe metal was \u201ccoined\u201d and the\nmetal so stamped became known as\na \u201ccoin\u201d. According to Herodotus,\nthe first mint was established by\nGyges of Lydia by the end of the\n8th century B.C. for coining of\ngold, silver, and electrum. Silver\nwas coined on the Island of Aegiana\nand the art was introduced by the\nGreeks into Italy, Persia, India, and\ncountries bordering the Mediterra-\nnean. Later the Romans laid the\nfoundation of modern minting, and\nthe art originated quite independ-\nently at a later date in China, and\nspread to Japan and Korea. The\nRomans, at first, cast their large\ncopper coins, but it was soon\nrealized that the perfection of\nform found on many of the ancient,\nas well as many of the modern,\ncoins, could not be achieved by a\ncasting technique.\n\nIn the kingdom of Europe, the\nsupply of bullion often came from\nmines owned by the king. The\nright of seigniorage was often\nwaived to encourage subjects to\nbring gold and silver to the mint.\nIn spite of this, supplies were\nusually short and the alchemists\nenjoyed a heigh-day in trying to\neffect the transmutation of base\nmetal into gold.\n\nIn Britain, coining preceded the\nRoman conquest. Later, following\nthe Norman invasion, there were\n70 or more mints throughout the\nBritish Isles \u2014 this is a greater\nnumber than now exists in the\nwhole world. The large number\nwas due to low production techni-\n\nques and lack of transportation.\nCoins were periodically tested at\nWestminster to check on the\nweight and fineness, and to do so\nrequired a staff of nearly 1,200 su-\npervisory officers. \u2018These officers,\non behalf of the king, also collected\nseigniorage, which was generally a\ndeduction from the amount of\nbullion sent to the mint for\ncoinage, but work was done by\ncontractors at great profit. Sir\nIsaac Newton was appointed Master\nof the Mint and Contractor of the\nCoinage in recognition of his\nservices. \u2018The London mint was\nbuilt in 1810, and in 1850 the\ncontract system was abolished, since\nwhich time the work has been done\nby Civil Servants with profits going\nto the State.\n\nIn India, hand minting persisted\nin native states until the 19th cen-\ntury. The first Rupee of modern\ntimes was struck on August 29th,\n1757, in Calcutta. The coins were\ncrude, struck between dies with a\nhammer. Rolling mills, drawn by\nabout 40 coolies, were used. Melt-\ning was done in a large open fire of\ncharcoal, where the heat and fumes\nwere often severe enough to drive\naway the most vigilant inspector.\nUnder these circumstances, the job\nwas no doubt profitable to the\nmelters.\n\nIn 1824 the Indian Government\nestablished two mints, one at\nCalcutta and the other at Bombay,\nwhich were among the largest in\nthe world at that time with the\nexception of the Philadelphia mint.\n\n(To be continued)\n\n\u2014 32 \u2014\n",

Thaw.\n\nThe retiring President, Mr. Bowman, addressed the meeting as\nfollows:\n\n\u201cThe Montreal Coin Club has now been in existence for more than\na year and, everything considered, I think it has been a very successful\nyear. While we cannot claim a rapid or extensive growth, the\nenthusiasm shown by the members has been most encouraging. <A very\nhigh percentage of the total membership attends the meetings and the\ninformal discussions that follow continue to be popular.\n\n\u2014 34 _\u2014\n",
    "41": "\u201cThrough the efforts of Mr. Rawlings, we were fortunate in obtaining\nthe use of the Boy Scouts\u2019 headquarters boardroom for our meetings and\nas this is centrally located and sufficiently large for our attendance, it has\nbeen very satisfactory.\n\n\u201cWhile we have not been able to have any outside speakers at any\nof our meetings, a number of short papers dealing with specific coins of\nthe Canadian series have been read. \u2018These have been published in the\nbulletin of the Canadian Numismatic Association.\n\n\u201cWe regret the death of one of our most popular and best informed\nmembers: Thomas Murray. He enjoyed attending our meetings and\nalways brought along most interesting specimens of Canadian and ancient\ncoins. He was one of the last direct links between the coin collectors of\ntoday and those of the 1890's as he had known personally many of the\noutstanding collectors of P. N. Breton\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nDr. Wasson then assumed the chair and, on behalf of the members,\npresented Mr. Bowman with an engraved silver tray as a token of their\nesteem and thanks for his guidance.\n\nThe Secretary-Treasurer reported a successful year financially, ending\nwith a surplus of $70.35.\n\nFollowing adjournment of the business meeting, Jack Lupovich\nshowed a recently acquired Newfoundland 5-cent silver piece dated 1873,\nwith mint mark \u201cH\u201d under the Queen\u2019s head. This would appear to be\nthe first of this date and mint mark found and is, of course, an addition\nto the Canadian dated decimal series. Any further information on this\npiece would be much appreciated. Mr. Lupovich also exhibited Canadian\nproof sets for 1908, 1911, 1937 and 1953, in cases, these being the first\ncoinage at the Canadian Mint (1908) and the first for George V,\nGeorge VI and Elizabeth II minted in Canada. The 1911 set included\nthe \u201cC\u201d mint mark sovereign.\n\nDr. Wasson had brought over with him three very fine drachms of\nAradus in Phoenicia, and three other ancient Greek coins, rare bronzes of\nvarious cities.\n\nW. H. Rawtines,\n\nSec.-Treas.\n\nTHE NORWOOD COIN CLUB met on December 14th, at the\nMetropole Hotel, and conducted its election of officers for the coming\nyear. The following members were elected and will be installed in office\nthe Ist January meeting: President, George Batsche; Vice-Pres., Bruce\nStowe; Sec.-Treas., Forrest P. Howe; Directors, Philip E. Lyon, Chairman,\nWm. Wagner and Al. Stuer.\n\n\u2014 35 \u2014\n",
    "42": "The Norwood Coin Club and Chapter #5 (with a membership of\ntwenty-four!) hold their meetings together. This cooperation between the\ntwo groups is working out very successfully; it creates a greater interest in\nthe coins of the U.S., Great Britain, and especially Canada. We are\nmembers of the A.N.A., the C.N.A., the Ohio State, and the Central\nStates Numismatic Association.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, a small auction was held conducted\nby one of our newest members, Mr. McBrayer. A tentative date has also\nbeen selected for our annual banquet.\n\nForrest P. Howe,\nSec.-Treas.\n\nTHE TORONTO COIN CLUB\u2019s meeting of December the 17th\nwas attended by twenty-one members and two visitors, George H.\nPhillips, of Schenectady, N.Y., and Miss Nola Crewe who was one of two\nnew members signed up at this meeting. Norman B. Mason, Vice-\nPresident, was in the chair.\n\nNo speaker was featured at this meeting, but many items of business\ncame up for discussion. Plans of many Club activities were proposed for\nthe coming year, and beyond, many of which will require much\nconsideration.\n\nThe officers elected for the 1956 term were: President, Dr. J. S.\nWilkinson; Vice-President, Fred C. Jewett; Secretary, Peter S. Favro;\nTreasurer, Mrs. Louise Graham; Librarian, Mrs. Freda Peddie; Directors,\nNorman B. Mason, G. Max Skinner and Clare Kekewich.\n\nThese, along with Vincent G. Greene, the immediate past-President\nwill constitute the Executive Committee for this year.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, a small auction was conducted by\nClare Kekewich. Light refreshments were served while many animated\ndiscussions were in progress.\n\nPeter S. Favro,\nSecretary.\n\nCRY G5\n\naw 98 ce\n",

    "56": "Notes of Steps Leading to the Establishment\nin Ottawa of a Branch of the Koyal Mint\n\nA. P. WitiiaMs, Master,\n- Royal Canadian Mint\n\nIn the closing years of the Nineteenth Century, when the gold\nproduction of British Columbia was running over 200,000 ounces fine a\nyear, and when in addition a flood from the Yukon was pouring into that\nProvince an agitation began for the establishment of a Mint, on the\nground that such an institution would stabilize the local price of the\nmetal, then being exported to U.S.A., and would stimulate development\nand promote trade in Western Canada. The subject was taken up by\nthe Hon. W. S. Fielding, Minister of Finance for the Dominion, and\nafter correspondence with the High Commissioner as to the status of a\nMint in Canada, and the proper procedure, matters which received the\npersonal attention of Mr. Courtney, Deputy Minister of Finance, on a\nvisit to London in 1901, it was decided that a branch Mint on the lines\nof those in Australia should be established and on the 2nd May, 1901,\nMr. Fielding gave notice in the House of Commons of a resolution for\nthe provision of a sum of $75,000 as an Annuity for maintenance of a\nbranch of the Royal Mint in Canada. The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901,\nfounded on this resolution received the royal assent on the 23rd May, 1901.\n(The Annuity has since been increased to $200,000.)\n\nThe possible advantage to the gold producers was by no means the\nonly, perhaps not even the deciding factor, in determining on the\nestablishment of a local Mint. Though Canada had never possessed its\nown gold currency, and held its reserves, both governmental and banking,\nin gold coin of another country, or in gold bullion, it was thought that a\npolicy of keeping its reserves in domestic coin might be inaugurated, and\nit was further considered that, if only as a matter of national pride, the\nDominion should be in a position to strike its own token coinage. There\nwould have been no objection raised by the Imperial Government to the\nestablishment of a Mint entirely controlled by the Dominion Govern-\nment, were its operations to be confined to this purely domestic coinage,\nbut it was felt that as Canadian gold coins would not circulate outside\nthe Dominion, and that even locally the demand for them would be\nlimited, the coinage of gold would only be justified by its conversion\ninto a coin of such universal acceptance as the sovereign, and this could\nonly be done in a branch of the Royal Mint.\n\nWhen the Ottawa Mint Act was passed negotiations with the British\nGovernment were commenced. It soon became clear that the coinage of\ngold would not be on nearly so large a scale as first anticipated, partly\nbecause it was seen that the demand for coin would be limited, but\n\n\u2014 44 \u2014\n",
    "57": "chiefly because of the great decrease in production of the metal in British\nColumbia and the Yukon. It was finally decided that provision should\nbe made for a coinage of 20,000,000 pieces a year of all denominations,\nwith a gold refinery on a very small scale, and buildings were erected and\nthe machinery installed on that basis. The Treasury made it quite clear\nthat no financial responsibility would be accepted by the British\nGovernment, all costs of maintenance to be met from the Annuity, with\nthe exception of the upkeep of the buildings.\n\nThere were various delays in the completion of the building and the\npurchase of the machinery, and the Ottawa Mint Proclamation, 1907,\nissued under the Imperial Coinage Act, 1870, fixed the Ist January, 1908,\nas the formal date of the establishment of the Ottawa Branch Mint.\n\nEditor's Page\n\n(Continued from page 45)\n\nAccording to a recent Canadian Press report, Canada\u2019s output of\ncoins, in 1955, more than doubled the 1954 coinage to a total of about\n80 millions, from 37 millions in 1954. The face value of the 1954\namounted to a little under $2144 million while the 1955 exceeds 5 million\ndollars. \u2018This seems to be a lucrative business for the government as the\nprofit (as opposed to seigniorage) amounted to over 40% ar about\n$1,100,000 in 1954 and will be proportionately larger for 1955. The C.P.\nreport goes on to say that the Mint can turn out 100 million coins a year,\na figure that was almost reached in 1953 with a coinage of about\n97 millions. The one-cent piece retains its undisputed numerical superi-\nority, with a mintage of over 56 millions in 1955. The above news release\nwould seem to indicate substantial numbers of each denomination of\ncoins for 1955. The official report of Coins Minted will be published as\nsoon as official figures are available, probably in time for the May edition\nof the Journal.\n\nWayne S. Rich, of Concord, N.H., reports that he has a specimen of\nthe Breton 527 token which appears to be of metal other than copper,\nperhaps copper-nickel.

    "58": "Counterstamped or C ountermarked\nCanadian Coins\nby Maurice M. Goutp,\n\nBoston, Mass.\n\nOne of the very unusual phases of Numismatics is the classifying and\ncollecting of counterstamped coins. There were several reasons for the\ncounterstamping of coins, but most of the Canadian pieces that I have\ncome across are counterstamped for advertising purposes. Many coins are\njust countermarked with initials and names and sometimes dates, as\nremembrances, souvenirs, etc.\n\nIt would be of no value to list these and they are fairly common.\n\nSeveral years ago when I listed the U.S. counterstamped coins, I\nmentioned that these pieces were rare in almost all cases. The Canadian\ncounterstamps are even rarer, and with the exception of the Devins\n& Bolton counterstamp, they are almost unobtainable.\n\n1. The most common Canadian counterstamp is that of Devins\n& Bolton of Montreal, who were well known druggists. They obtained a\nquantity of U.S. large cents and they were stamped \u201cDevins & Bolton,\nMontreal\u201d. I had in my collection all dates of U.S. large cents from\n1826 to 56, as well as various varieties and seven or eight dates before 1826,\nincluding a 1798, which is the earliest date I have ever seen. The same\ncounterstamp is to be found in any number of Canadian tokens from\nBouquet Sous to the Wellingtons. I have also seen two examples struck\non U.S. Colonials, a Connecticut cent and. a Vermont cent. Another\nvariety is just the word \u201cBolton\u2019s\u201d struck on several Canadian tokens.\n\n2. A very unusual counterstamp is that of O. T. Peterson, CH,\ntown, P.E.I. in a circle on a 1794 2 reale. This is extremely rare.\n\n3. S. P. & Co. struck on half-penny bank of Upper Canada, 1852.\n4.

St. Andrew\u2019s Chapter on Nova Scotia 1840 one penny token.\nThis is probably a Masonic piece.\n\nI hope that this will stimulate some interest in this field and that\nother collectors will send a list of their pieces.\n\n\u2014 48 \u2014\n",
    "59": "Numismatic Items from the Daily Press\nMajor Sheldon S. Carrot, C.D.\n\nDuring the past few months the daily press has published a\nconsiderable number of items of interest to numismatists. Several of\nthese are commented upon below.\n\nRecord Coin Prices\n\nAn article in the London Times, republished in several Canadian\nnewspapers, reports that: \u201cFor the third day in succession, the world\nauction record price for a single coin was broken at the concluding session\nof the four-day sale of the first part of the late R. C. Lockett\u2019s collection\nof Greek coins, when Dr. Cahn gave \u00a32,400 for the Attic silver Syracuse\n412 B.C. dekadrachm by the engraver Kimon (first type).\u201d The London\nTimes is noted for the accuracy of its despatches but in this instance its\nreporter was not fully informed on coin values. \u00a32,400 or $6,720 may be\na record auction price for a single coin in the United Kingdom or it may\nbe a world record for an ancient coin but it most certainly is not a record\nfor coins generally. For example: in April, 1954 the R. Coulton Davis\nspecimen of the U.S. 1804 silver dollar sold in New York for $8,000 and\nthe Wm. F. Dunham specimen of the U.S. 1822, $5.00 gold sold in\nJune, 1941 for $11,575.\n\nFrench-Canadian Card Money\n\nAccording to \u201cBelieve It or Not\u201d Bob Ripley, Camille Ledoux of\nQuebec was sentenced to have his arms tied behind his back for three\nyears, 1702-1705, for forging a playing card.\u2019 In those days playing cards,\nproperly endorsed, were used as currency in French Canada.\n\nBank of British North America\n\nMost collectors of Canadian paper money know that the Bank of\nBritish North America commenced business in Canada in 1836 and was\nabsorbed by the Bank of Montreal in 1918. An excellent article in a\nrecent issue of the Ottawa Journal tells how an agent of this bank made\na name for himself in another way. In the 1840's, John MacKinnon\ncame to Bytown (now Ottawa) from England as the Agent of the Bank\nof British North America. In the years 1854 and 1855 he built a stately\nstone house overlooking the Ottawa River. This house, which later\nreceived the name of Earnscliffe, was destined to become the home of\nCanada\u2019s first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. To-day it is the\nofficial residence of the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada.\n\nCoin Preferences\n\nThe Washington Daily News reports that the Philadelphia Mint\nfinds that the demand for fifty cent pieces is decreasing steadily. In 1954\n\not, HE\n",
    "60": "only four million-new half dollars went into circulation compared with\n21 million quarters and 215 million cents. The Director of the Mint\nstates that stores don\u2019t seem to be giving half dollars in change any\nmore and people prefer quarters to use in coin vending machines. The\nOttawa Journal reveals much the same situation in Canada. According\nto figures obtained from the Bank of Canada silver dollars are not\npopular, fifty cent pieces are in smaller demand, twenty-five cent pieces\nhave recovered from a slump, dimes are popular, nickels are less in\ndemand and cents came back strongly in 1955. The public\u2019s wishes in\nrespect to coin are shown in the requisitions to the Bank of Canada\nwhich transmits the orders for new coins to the Royal Canadian Mint.\nChanges in demand for coins occur but the reasons are never definitely\nestablished and they may be numerous. A change in street railway or bus\nfares, for example, will alter the demand for certain coins in one city\nand the installation of parking meters in another city will increase the\ndemand. Preliminary figures show that Royal Canadian Mint production\nfigures for 1955 in comparison with 1954 were as follows: silver dollars\nwere up a little; fifty cent pieces were up slightly; quarters were more\nthan treble; dimes were more than double; nickels were down a bit and\ncents were more than double.\n\nGeorge VI Bills All But Gone\n\nThe Ottawa Journal reports that Canada\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II\ncurrency, first issued in September, 1954, has all but replaced the King\nGeorge VI notes. Bank of Canada officials state that they are not\ndeliberately forcing the disappearance of the old notes but as they wear\nout they are withdrawn from circulation by the chartered banks and\nreturned to the central bank for destruction. The average life of a\nCanadian one dollar bill is roughly eight months and that of the other\ndenominations slightly longer.\n\nLIST OF PRICES REALIZED AT MAIL AUCTION\nOF JANUARY 7, 1956\n\nLot 1 _2 $368.50 1 $331.25\na adh rece 5 41.25 49.50\nmB as 34.35 42.75\nBe cies 50.00 20.25\nOe ee 44.00\n\nLots 10, 12, 13, 14 were sold by private treaty.

    "61": "Metallurgical Aspects of Coinage\nwith Special Keference to Nickel\n\n(Continued from February issue)\n\nIn March of 1952, a new modern\nmint was constructed at Alipore,\nwhich absorbed the Calcutta mint\nand has a capacity of over a million\ncoins per eight-hour shift.\n\nIn US. the first mint was set up\nin Boston in the year 1652. This\nmint coined the famous \u201cPine Tree\nShilling\u201d. Nearly a century and a\nhalf passed before the Philadelphia\nmint came into operation in 1792.\nThe coinage produced by the\nPhiladelphia mint was as set out in\nthe U.S. Constitution, based on the\ndollar, owing to the prevalence of\nSpanish dollars in circulation.\n\nIn Canada, prior to 1858, coinage\nwas mainly of British, U.S. and\nSpanish origin. From this date\nuntil 1908, the British North\nAmerican provinces, and later Can-\nada, obtained coinage from the\nLondon and Birmingham mints.\nIn 1908 the Ottawa mint came\ninto production as a branch of the\nRoyal Mint. In 1931 it came\nunder the jurisdiction of the Depart-\nment of Finance and was renamed\nthe Royal Canadian Mint.\n\nIn addition to handling domestic\ncoinage, which now includes New-\nfoundland, it has supplied much\nto Jamaica and other West Indian\ncountries. It also produces medal-\nlions and commemoratives pieces,\nand refines, essays, and acts as a\ndepository for gold.\n\nModern Minting\n\nIn ancient times, as well as the\nMiddle Ages, the production of\ncoinage was largely a hand opera-\ntion and their quantity restricted.\nThe ordinary man depended more\non the barter system for his daily\nrequirements.\n\nModern methods may be said to\ndate from 1553, when in Paris rolls\nwere used to reduce cast bars,\npunch presses for production of\nblanks, and screw presses for coin-\ning. England experimented with\nthis equipment shortly after its\nintroduction to France, but nearly\na century passed before she adopted\nthem.\n\nIn the 18th century a Bucking-\nham manufacturer named Boulton,\ntogether with inventor James Watt,\nfirst applied steam to the working\nof coinage machinery. In 1839\nUhlhorn developed the lever press\nwhich replaced screw presses. The\nmodern descendant of this press\nutilized the toggle principle and is\ncapable of striking coins in excess\nof 160 per minute.\n\nOur Ottawa mint is currently in\nthe midst of an expansion pro-\ngramme, which will ultramodernize\nit and increase its productive capa-\ncity nearly three times. It is\nexpected to be in full swing before\nthe end of the year. The annual\nrequirements for coinage in Canada\nhave grown and in recent years have\nexceeded one hundred million\n\na)\n",

The new plant will\nadhere to the single shift, regular\ncivil servant\u2019s hours, and is expected\nto be able to handle all the\nrequirements for years to come.\n\nFour new 200 pound melt induc-\ntion furnaces have been added to\nmake six furnaces in all. These\nare capable of pouring 200-pound\nheats into vertical water-cooled\npermanent molds, producing a slab\n14%\u201dx<8\u2019x4 ft. These slabs are\nconveyed to a new continuous\nrolling mill manufactured by\nDominion Engineering. The mill\nconsists of two sets of rolls, First,\nroughing rolls will handle the slabs,\nwhich are automatically passed\nbetween the rolls 7 or 8 times and\nthence automatically to the finish-\ning rolls where the very much\nelongated slab is cooled during its\nfirst pass and handled in coil form\nfor succeeding passes. When the\ncoil is reduced to the required\nthickness, it is passed to a slitter\nwhere it is sliced into three 2\u201d wide\ncoils. \u2018These are transferred to\n2 blanking presses where coin\nblanks are punched from the strip\nat high speed. The remaining\nscrap is chewed up into a size\nsuitable for remelting.\n\nAt this stage the metal has been\nquite severely worked and must be\nannealed or softened prior to the\nactual coining operation. The\nblanks are placed in furnaces and\nbrought up to the appropriate\ntemperature for softening, about\n1,450 degrees F, depending on the\n\nalloy, after which they are pickled\nto remove scale resulting from the\nhigh temperature operation and\nconveyed to an edging machine\nwhich smooths the edge and raises\nit slightly, to protect the face of\nth\u00e9 coin from wear.

Winxinson\n\nA lecture on \u201cCoin Collecting\u201d delivered in a museum appreciation course\nat the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, 28th of November, 1955\n\nCoin collecting covers so much\nterritory that some fields will have\nto be dealt with summarily. This\ntalk is one of a series on \u201cKnow\nYour Museum\u201d and, as the majority\nof coins here are ancient ones, that\nperiod will be given most attention.\nLeonard Forrer, in his recent book\non Coin Collecting, lists this Mu-\nseum among the eleven public\ncollections in North America where\ncoins can be seen satisfactorily.\n\nThe coins on display here are so\nwell-labelled that, instead of de-\nscribing them, it seems best to give\nyou background information.\n\nThe material is chosen arbitrarily\nbecause there were about two\nthousand ancient mints and an\naverage of one minute devoted to\neach would occupy about thirty-\nthree hours.\n\nThe traditional advantage of Mu-\nseums is that their material is\npresented in three dimensions. Only\ntwo further advantages could be\ndesired; first, to handle the items\nand, finally, to possess them. The\nlate Rev. E. A. Sydenham used to\ntell about a tour of European\n\nMuseums in search of material on\nthe coinage of Nero. At one\nItalian Museum he was rebuffed\nrepeatedly when he asked to see its\ncoins. Finally, he told the curator\nthat he would call every day \u2014 for\na year if necessary \u2014 until his re-\nquest was granted. \u2018The curator,\nwho was also a professor at the\nlocal university and had some know-\nledge of the tenacity of English-\nmen, submitted and made an\nappointment. In due course,\nSydenham was met by the curator,\na porter with a massive bunch of\nkeys, two civilians who looked like\ndetectives and a civil guard in full\nuniform. This procession moved\nthrough hall after hall, with doors\nbeing locked behind it, until finally\nthe coin cabinets were reached.\nWhen these were unlocked, the\ndust on the coins was so thick\nthat it was difficult to see the\ndetails on them. However, Syden-\nham found what he wanted, made\nsome notes and thanked the curator\nbut suggested that a clergyman\nhardly required such supervision.\nTo which the curator replied: \u201cThey\nwere not watching you, they were\nwatching me.\u201d\n\n\u2014 53 \u2014\n",
    "64": "At all events, we are not disturb-\ning the Museum\u2019s collection but\nsome of us have brought a few\ncoins which you may examine and\nhandle at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe formal title of coin collect-\ning is numismatics which comes\nfrom the Greek \u201cnomisma\u201d mean-\ning literally \u2014what is sanctioned\nby law \u2014 and that could embrace a\ngreat deal. In fact, numismatics\ndeals with coins, coin weights,\njetons, tokens, paper currency, prim-\nitive currency, medals, orders and\ndecorations.\n\nPrimitive currency, as dealt with\nby coin collectors, covers the un-\nusual items used by peoples in a\nprimitive stage of civilization.\n\nIt ranges from the tiny shells of\nIndian Wampum to the Stone\nMoney of the Caroline Islands\nwhere the largest pieces were ten\nto twelve feet across. These might\nseem too big for collecting but at\na recent meeting of the Toronto\nCoin Club we were introduced to\na gentleman who collects full-size\nlocomotives.\n\nBeads or Shells may have been\nthe first form of currency ever used.\n\nCowrie Shells have been used as\ncurrency over very wide areas of the\nworld and over long periods of\ntime.\n\nIn China, a metal imitation of\nCowrie Shells circulated as early as\nthe 6th century B.C. The actual\nshells suggested a little pig to the\nItalians who called them porcellana.\nWhen Chinese translucent ceramics\nwere first seen, the resemblance to\nthe shells was so striking that the\n\nname was taken over by the cerani-\nics which we now know as porcelain\nin English.\n\nThe point of mentioning this\nname-transfer is that many coin\nterms have changed over the long\nhistory of coinage and are still\nchanging. Therefore, definitions\nwill be avoided except such basic\nones as these: Metal when used to\nfacilitate the exchange of goods is\nCurrency; currency when used ac-\ncording to specific weight-standards\nis Money; and money stamped with\na device is a Coin.\n\nThe peoples of Egypt and Mes-\nopotamia were using gold, silver,\nelectrum and bronze by weight\nbefore 1600 B.C. However, the\nage of internationalism seems to\nhave begun at about this period:\nand frequent commercial contacts\nwere being made with pastoral and\nhighland peoples whose wealth was\nreckoned in flocks and herds. It\nmay be of interest to note that our\nlanguage still uses the word \u201cfee\u201d\nfrom the German root for sheep\nand \u201cpecuniary\u201d from the Latin\nterm for cattle.\n\nIt seems that most of the trading\nof Egyptians, Babylonians and\nPhoenicians with the northern\npeoples took place in such islands\nas Crete and Cyprus. A system of\ngenerally recognized values was\nevolved in the Aegean, based on\nthe ox-unit because an ox couldn\u2019t\nbe divided up without reducing its\nvalue.\n\nThe price of an ox in gold was\nabout 8.5 grammes while the cop-\nper or bronze price was more than\n\n= 4\n",
    "65": "3,000 times that weight \u2014 25.5 kilo-\ngrammes (about 60 lbs.). A fairly\nlarge number of the copper and\nbronze talents, cast in the shape of\nox-hides, have been found in\nCyprus, Cilicia, Crete and Sardinia.\n\nAn Egyptian wall-painting of the\n15th century B.C. shows both\nCretans and Syrians bringing these\ncopper ingots as tribute to the\nPharaoh, so they constitute our\noldest form of money, as distinct\nfrom currency.\n\nThe people of Mesopotamia used\na gold unit of weight \u2014 the Shekel\n\u2014 of 8.34 g. Sixty Shekels equalled\n1 manah and 60 manah equalled\n1 biltu, which corresponded roughly\nwith the heavy copper ox-unit. The\nintermediate weight unit was so\nuseful in commerce that the Greeks\nadopted it sometime between 1000\nand 800 B.C. Incidentally, you can\nrecognize the source of our 60 sec-\nonds=1 minute, 60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nThe ancient weight-standards for\nprecious metals varied from country\nto country and from time to time.\nThe subject is of importance to\ncollectors of ancient coins but it is\ntoo tedious to deal with at length.\nThe fact that there were numerous\nweight-standards is mentioned to\navoid giving you an impression that\nfinancial affairs were simple in\nancient times. Even when the\nRomans reached Syria, the books of\na Damascus hotel-keeper show\naccounts kept in twelve different\ncurrencies. The ratio of gold to\nsilver fluctuated from time to time\nto complicate matters for the\nchartered accounts of those days.\n\nThe first true coinage commenced\nin Lydia, a Hellenized kingdom in\nAsia Minor, during the seventh\ncentury B.C. There is much\ndebate on just what period in the\nseventh century and the argument\nis confused by the fact that all of\nthe fairly large number of coins\nfound during the British Museum\nexcavations at Ephesus have \u201cdis-\nappeared\u201d from the Istanbul Muse-\num where they had been deposited.\n\nThe first coins were made of\nelectrum \u2014a mixture of gold and\nsilver \u2014 then regarded as a separate\nmetal because it was found in the\nrivers and mines of Western An-\natolia as a natural alloy. Bean-\nshaped dumps of electrum had\nbeen used as currency for hundreds\nof years. Then it seems that traders\ncommenced marking these dumps\nwith private symbols in a manner\nsimilar to the custom of relatively\nmodern Chinese merchants putting\ntheir chop-marks on all coins passing\nthrough their hands. The com-\nmonest ancient method was to file\na nail part way through, then break\nthe rest off, making a punch that\ncould not be duplicated. Finally,\ndumps of uniform weight were\nmade and the royal arms marked\non them as a guarantee of weight\nand quality.\n\nAll subsequent coins were marked\nwith symbols of royal, state or\nreligious guarantee of quality but\nthere were so many skeptics in\nthose days that many surviving\ncoins are marred by a chisel cut\nmade to check that the quality was\nmore than skin-deep.\n\ney 85) nes\n",
    "66": "The percentage of gold in elec-\ntrum varied, so the next advance\nin coinage was made when the\nfamous Croesus struck coins of pure\ngold and pure silver. Also, he\nmade a clever adjustment of the\nrespective weights of gold and\nsilver coins to circumvent the\nawkward fact that the value of\ngold to silver at that time was\n13% to 1. Thus 10 of his silver\npieces of 10.72 g. or 20 pieces of\n5.36 g. equalled the value of his\ngold coin of 8.04 g. It seems that\nCroesus was clever and wealthy\nenough to win friends and influence\n\noracles but still was defeated and\ncaptured by Cyrus the Great of\nPersia in 546 B.C.\n\nThe Persians had used only un-\nstamped metal as currency until\nthe capture of Lydia. Cyrus soon\nissued coins of Lydian style and\nadopted the clever weight system\nwhereby 20 silver pieces equalled\n1 gold coin: He used the ancient\nBabylonian weight-standard and\nthe gold coin was about the same\nweight as an English Sovereign.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nSpecial announcement\n\nWESTERN ROUND-UP OF COIN COLLECTORS\nIN THE PRAIRIE ROOM OF DRAKE HOTEL,\nREGINA, SASKATCHEWAN, ON MAY 20, 1956\n\nThe REGINA COIN CLUB (Chapter #6) has sponsored this event\nin conjunction with the WINNIPEG, CALGARY, and EDMONTON\n\nCoin Clubs.\nselection of Canadian coins.\nwill be on display.\n\n9.00 A.M.

This deserves the support of all Collec-\ntors who can possibly attend. The distances from Vancouver to Regina\nand from the eastern provinces to Saskatchewan are quite considerable,\nbut there should be a fair representation from both sections. Those un-\nable to be present can give them our moral support and examine the\nauction list. In any case we wish the members of the Regina Coin Club\nthe best of luck, and may the Manitoba, Calgary and Edmonton Clubs\ngive them their full support.\n\nAccording to reports from our two most westerly Chapters, the mem-\nbers were outnumbered at their respective February meetings by visitors\nand guests. Calgary members were outnumbered 24 to 16, and although\nVancouver didn\u2019t mention any figures they did report being outnumbered\nby visitors at a well attended meeting. Both Chapters gained new mem-\nbers which is, of course, very gratifying.\n\nIt may well be pointed out here that Chapters now have a 20%\nmargin to work with, being required to have but 80% membership in\nthe C.N.A. This should make it easier to form new Chapters, and those\nremaining out of the Association for the time being could be enlisted\nlater.\n\nReport from Flin Flon, Manitoba, quoting a bank official as saying\nthat an 1857 Bank of Upper Canada penny token is worth $2000.00, set\nthe usual wave of inquiries across the country. Every radio station and\nnewspaper office received floods of calls, most of which are usually passed\non to local collectors. \u2018This report was immediately and expertly quashed\nby our President, Mr. G. R. L. Potter, in a letter to the press. It is of\ncourse difficult for the uninitiated to understand that such a token retails\nat 20c in very good condition, even though it is 100 years old. This\nalso illustrates the fact that a banker is not necessarily a numismatist, in\nfact it is not part of his business.\n\nSome correspondence has been received concerning our Elizabethan\nnotes having an asterisk in front of the serial numbers. This has been\nfully covered at the end of \u201cDescription of Bank of Canada Notes Issue\nof 1954\u201d published on page 12 of the October, 1954, Bulletin of the\nC.N.A. The answer is that \u201cNotes spoiled in printing are replaced with\nnotes bearing an asterisk in front of the letters which precede the serial\nnumbers.\u201d Some seem to be under the impression that the \u201casterisk\u201d\nnotes will be quite valuable in time, but this has not been borne out\nin their American counterparts, the \u201cStar\u201d notes. Low serial numbers\nare desirable in notes of any kind, with or without the asterisk or star.\nWould it be more proper.to class \u201casterisk\u201d notes as oddities, in about\nthe same class as die-breaks or other freaks in coins? Could we have\nsome expression of views and ideas on, this ?\n\n\u2014 69 \u2014\n",
    "84": "Canadian Paper Money\n\nA lecture given by Major S. S. Carroll, CD, before the Ottawa Chapter,\non February 13, 1956.\n\nThe collecting of Canadian pa-\nper money has not always been a\npopular branch of our hobby. Be-\nfore World War II, I believe that\nyou could count the serious collec-\ntors of Canadian paper money on\nthe fingers of your two hands. This\nwas reflected in auction catalogues\nand dealer\u2019s price lists. Only very\nseldom were any items listed and\nwhen they were, they were usually\ninadequately described. These in-\nfrequent listings were largely con-\nfined to broken bank bills and mer-\nchants\u2019 notes. These notes often\nsold at auction for as little as 25c\nto 50c each. Occasionally, scarce\nand rare items brought more than\na dollar. Generally speaking no\none knew which notes were scarce\norrare. Dominion of Canada notes\nand redeemable notes of the char-\ntered banks were listed even less\nfrequently. These usually brought\nonly a very little over face value,\neven when in uncirculated condi-\ntion. In some cases, because of\nthe discount on the Canadian\ndollar, such notes were sold at less\nthan face value in the United\nStates.\n\nAnother indication of the lack\nof interest in Canadian paper\nmoney was the complete absence of\nliterature for the collectors of such\nmaterial. \u2018The first books written\nfor the Canadian paper money\ncollectors appeared in 1954. Up\nuntil this time the only literature\navailable to collectors was that deal-\n\ning with the history of banks and\nbanking, written primarily for ban-\nkers and economists. \u2018These were\nnot without value to the collector\nfor they gave much historical back-\nground on the early Canadian banks\nand occasionally listed their notes\nand illustrated some of them. The\nFrench writer E. Zay, James Ste-\nvenson and R. W. McLachlan pro-\nduced short works on Card Money.\nAdam Short and R. M. Brecken-\ntidge wrote excellent histories on\nthe Canadian banking system and\nseveral of the chartered banks have\nturned out useful histories of their\nown institutions and the other\nbanks which they have taken over.\nAmong bank histories, those of the\nBank of Montreal, Bank of Nova\nScotia, Dominion Bank and Royal\nBank are good and the three-volume\nHistory of the Canadian Bank of\nCommerce is outstanding. Practi-\ncally all of the books that I have\njust mentioned are out of print and\ncan be obtained only by systema-\ntically searching the second-hand\nbookstores. Later on I will men-\ntion in detail the more modern\nbooks that have been written during\nthe past few years for collectors.\n\nCanadian paper money can be\ngrouped into six broad classifica-\ntions \u2014 the card money and ordon-\nnances of the French period, the\nArmy Bills of 1812-1815, merchants\u2019\nnotes or bons, broken bank bills,\nredeemable notes of the chartered\nbanks and Government notes. This\n\nas OY es\n",
    "85": "classification is roughly a chronolo-\ngical one although there is a cer-\ntain amount of overlapping. I\nintend to deal with each group in\norder.\n\nIn the early days of French\nCanada, one of the greatest prob-\nlems was the shortage of currency.\nIn 1670, the special Gloriam Regni\ncoins were brought in, but they\nsoon disappeared as did other sup-\nplies of coins that were brought in\nfrom time to time. The trouble\nwas that the colony, in spite of\nthe rich trade in furs, imported\nmore than it exported. In addition,\nthe taxes had to be paid to France\nin cash. Finally in 1685 the Inten-\ndant Jacques de Meulles, faced with\nthe immediate necessity of paying\nthe troops, decided to resort to\npaper money. But he was faced\nwith two obstacles \u2014 there was no\nprinting press in Canada and the\nonly paper was writing paper, to-\ntally unsuitable for paper money.\nHe hit on an expedient that re-\nsulted in a type of paper money\nwhich was to become famous in\nboth Canadian history and Cana-\ndian numismatics, namely money\nmade from playing cards. \u2018The first\ncards were issued in three denom-\ninations \u2014 four livres on an entire\ncard, two livres on half a card and\nfifteen sols on a quarter card. He\nhad his clerk of the treasury ins-\ncribe on each a \u201cbon\u201d or statement\nthat the card was \u201cgood for four\nlivres, etc.\u201d These he signed and\nsealed in wax with his own seal,\nwhile the clerk of the treasury\ncountersigned them as they were\nissued. Later issues were signed by\nthe Governor also. Because of the\n\nlack of space the quarter cards were\nfrequently signed just with an ini\ntial instead of the full name. No\nspecimens of the card money issued\nby de Meulles are known to exist.\nAgain and again the need for card\nmoney occurred and the need was\nmet by successive Intendants and\nGovernors. Efforts were made to\nredeem the cards when coin be-\ncame available from France, but\nthe need for more cards soon arose\nagain. Each new issue replaced the\nprevious issue and stiff penalties\nwere imposed on anyone who kept\nold cards after new ones were\nissued. \u2018This accounts for the fact\nthat not a single specimen remains\nto-day of the first eight issues. From\n1685 to 1760 there were no less\nthan 22 issues of card money. \u2018The\ntotal issue ran into the equivalent\nof many millions of dollars. In spite\nof the tremendous number of cards\nrepresented by this large sum, less\nthan 100 specimens of card money\nare known to exist to-day. Most\nspecimens are in public collections\nin France and Canada. Very few\nspecimens are in the hands of pri-\nvate collectors. After the fall of\nNew France the French Govern-\nment repudiated all the card money\nand the many millions of dollars\nworth of ordonnances that were\noutstanding. \u2018The British Govern-\nment voted a small sum and a con-\nsiderable number of the cards were\nredeemed but at only 25% of their\nface value. This unfortunate situa-\ntion created among the French\nCanadians a distrust of paper\nmoney that was slow to die.\n\nArmy Bills were the method\nadopted by the British Government\n\n== 7], ==\n",
    "86": "to finance the War of 1812-1815 in\nCanada. Prior to the passing of\nthe \u201cAct to Facilitate the Circula-\ntion of Army Bills\u201d, the currency\nof Canada consisted of a variety\nof coins. In the absence of a colo-\nnial coinage, the gold and silver\ncoins of several nations were in cir-\nculation. Spanish, Portuguese,\nFrench and American circulated\nsimultaneously with the gold and\nsilver coins of Great Britain. This\nlimited supply of currency was, of\ncourse, insufficient to meet the\nneeds of war. Accordingly bills were\nissued in the denominations of 25,\n50, 100 and 400 Spanish dollars, all\nbearing interest at 6% per annum.\nLater in the war, bills were issued\nin the denominations of 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, and 10 Spanish dollars. These\nbore no interest. All of the bills\nbelow the $25 denomination were\npayable on demand. At the end\nof the war, all outstanding bills\nwere redeemed in gold and silver\nby the British Government which\naccounts for their rarity to-day.\nThis action did much to create\nconfidence in paper money in Cana-\nda and paved the way for mer-\nchants\u2019 notes or \u201cbons\u201d which soon\nbegan to appear to help overcome\nthe chronic shortage of currency in\nthe young colony.\n\nThe first merchants\u2019 notes to be\nissued after the British conquest of\nCanada were those of George King,\na Quebec City merchant who issued\nnotes in 1772. Dobie & Badgley, a\nMontreal firm, issued notes in 1790.\nFew others are known until after\nthe War of 1812. The issue of\n\nmerchants\u2019 notes reached a_ peak\nduring the years 1837 and 1838.\n\nThe great increase may be attribut-\ned partly to the political disturb-\nances in Lower Canada and partly\nto the economic conditions at. that\ntime. Certainly one of the largest\nissues was that of the Distillerie de\nSt. Denis, which was owned by\nDr. Wolfred Nelson, chief lieute-\nnant of Louis Joseph Papineau, the\nleader of the rebellion in Lower\nCanada. The issuing of merchants\u2019\nnotes had pretty well died out by\nthe middle 1840's. The disappear-\nance of this form of currency was\nlargely due to the fact that,. by this\ntime, a number of banks were in\noperation and were issuing an ade-\nquate supply of paper money.\n\nIn 1792, three Montreal firms\norganized the Canada Banking\nCompany, a private bank chiefly\nof deposit. It survived only a few\nyears and only one specimen of\nits notes is known. It is in the\ncollection of the Canadian Bank\nof Commerce. The next bank to\ncome into existence was the Bank\nof Montreal or the Montreal Bank,\nas it was known at that time. It\nwas founded in 1817 and obtained\nits charter in 1822. It has the\nhonour of being Canada\u2019s oldest\nbank. It was followed by the Que-\nbec Bank and the Bank of Canada,\nin 1818, and the Bank of Upper\nCanada, Kingston in 1819. During\nthe 1820\u2019s 4 banks were founded;\nduring the 30\u2019s\u201419; none were\nformed in the 40\u2019s ; during the 50\u2019s\n\u201415 more appeared; during the\n60\u2019s\u201417; during the 70\u2019s\u201419;\nduring the 80\u2019s \u2014 5 ; during the 90\u2019s\n\u2014none; and since the turn of the\ncentury 15 more have been added.\nOf the more than one hundred\n\n\u2014 72 \u2014\n",
    "87": "banks that have been established in\nCanada, only nine survive to-day.\nThe others disappeared as a result\nof failures, absorptions and amal-\ngamations. Most of our Canadian\nbanks have operated under a gov-\nermment charter but a few got\nalong without one in the early days.\nMany of our banks were short-lived,\n(some of them lasting only a year\nor so) but others have celebrated\ntheir 100th anniversary. Many of\nthe early ones were small institu-\ntions with the capital held by one\nor more individuals and serving but\na single community with but one\nbranch. Some banks failed com-\npletely, others paid a part of their\nobligations ; others were taken over\nby stronger banks at no loss to the\nnote holders. The banks that fail-\ned completely are known as \u201cbro-\nken banks\u201d. As a general rule their\nnotes are not rare as they were not\nrecalled for redemption. The notes\nissued by those that paid something\non their notes and the notes of the\nones that were taken over by other\nbanks are very scarce to-day as most\nspecimens were turned in. In 1890,\nby a revision of the Bank Act, a\nBank Note Circulation Redemption\nFund was established. All banks\nwere required to deposit with the\nMinister of Finance a sum equal\nto 5% of their average note circu-\nlation. These deposits provided a\nredemption fund from which notes\ncould be redeemed in the event of\na bank failure. As a result of this,\nthe notes of any bank that has fail-\ned since 1890 are redeemable at\nface value if they are presented to\nthe Bank of Canada. Among the\ncollectors of Canadian paper money\n\nto-day, the term \u201cchartered bank-\nnotes\u201d is frequently misused. There\nseems to be a rather general miscon-\nception that all notes of chartered\nbanks are redeemable. This is not\nso. Many of the early banks which\nfailed completely, and which are\nknown as \u201c\u2018broken banks\u201d, had char-\nters. Notes that are still worth face\nvalue should be referred to simply\nas \u201credeemable notes\u201d. In 1950\nthe ten Canadian chartered banks\nlost the right to issue bank notes.\nTheir notes were withdrawn from\ncirculation and replaced by those\nof the Bank of Canada.\n\nThe first notes of the Dominion\nof Canada were issued in 1870 in\nthe denominations of 25c, $1 and\n$2. Later, notes for $4, $5, $50,\n$500 and $1,000. appeared. In 1935\nthe Dominion of Canada notes\nwere replaced by the Bank of Cana-\nda notes in the denominations of\n1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 500 and\n1,000 dollars.\n\nWhile on the subject of Govern-\nment notes as. distinguished from\nthose issued by banks, we should\nmention the Prince Edward Island\nTreasury Notes issued first in 1790\nand in ever increasing quantities in\nthe 1820's, 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s; the\nNova Scotia \u2018Treasury: Notes issued\nfrom 1812 down to Confederation ;\nthe Province of Canada Notes\nissued in 1866; and the Newfound-\nland. Government Cash Notes\nissued from 1901 to 1914, and the\none issue of Government of New-\nfoundland $1 and $2 notes in 1920.\nAll of these are either scarce or\nTare. :\n\n\u2014 Tim\n",
    "88": "The collecting of paper money\nis the one field that brings numis-\nmatists and philatelists together. A\nconsiderable number of Canadian\nstamp collectors also collect Cana-\ndian paper money. The reason for\nthis is fairly obvious \u2014 both paper\nmoney and stamps are printed on\npaper from engraved steel plates.\nIn many cases our early Canadian\npaper money and our early Cana-\ndian stamps were produced by the\nsame New York firms. The most\nfamous of these was the firm of\nRawdon, Wright, Hatch and\nEdson. In some cases the same\nvignettes have appeared on both\nour bank notes and our stamps.\nFor example: the same head of\nQueen Victoria appears on the $20\nnotes of the Peoples Bank of Hali-\nfax issued in 1864 as had been used\non the Ic, 2c and 5c stamps of\nNova Scotia in 1860; the same vi-\ngnette of the Prince of Wales in\nScottish costume was used in 1864\non both the $3 notes of the Central\nBank of New Brunswick and the\n17c stamp of New Brunswick ; and\nChalon\u2019s famous portrait of Victo-\ntia which was used on several early\nCanadian stamps was also used on\nthe bank notes of the Farmer\u2019s\nJoint Stock Bank, the Westmore-\nland Bank of New Brunswick and\nthe Zimmerman Bank.\n\nThis has been a very short and\nincomplete outline of the story of\nCanada\u2019s paper money. For those\nof you who are interested in pur-\nsuing the subject further there is\nnow available a small amount of\nliterature on the subject. I will\nmention four recent books on\nCanadian paper money \u2014 three of\nthem written specifically for collect-\nors. The first book, although writ-\nten primarily for bankers, is a very\nuseful book for the collector. It is\n\u201cCanadian Banks and Bank-Notes\n\u2014A Record\u201d by C. S. Howard,\npublished first in 1950 in The Cana-\ndian Banker and in the following\nyear in book form. The next two\nappeared almost simultaneously in\n1954. They are Canada and New-\nfoundland Paper Money, a priced\ncatalogue by J. E. Charlton and\nCanadian and Newfoundland Cur-\nrency by J. A. Elliott, Jr. In 1955,\nMr. Elliott published a supplemen-\ntary book, consisting almost enti-\nrely of plates, entitled The Curren-\ncies of Canada and Newfoundland.\nOne outstanding feature of the last\nthree books is their excellent illus-\ntrations of bank-notes issued by the\nCanadian and Newfoundland Gov-\nernments. \u2018There is still no cat-\nalogue of the notes of our many\nbanks.\n\nVy\n\n\u2014\n",

Holders fit\nin binders.\n\nWooden tray from my first small coin cabinet (now my son\u2019s), fitted with\nseparators to hold rows of coins of various sizes. \u2018This was empty.\n\nThese exhibits seemed to arouse such interest that \u201copen house\u201d at\n160 Symons St. was declared for March 3rd, so as to afford interested\npatties the opportunity of closer examination of a variety of holders (and\ncoins) not displayed at the meeting. The main point of interest seemed to\nbe my 148-tray coin cabinet. The trays are approximately 10\u201d x 14\u201d inside\ndimensions. One tray houses the complete issues of Newfoundland coins,\nexcept gold. The complete date sets of Canadian coins for the reigns\nof Queen Victoria, King Edward the Seventh, King George the Fifth,\nand King George the Sixth, are each contained in a separate tray. The\nsets are displayed in geometrical patterns designed to be symmetrical and\npleasing to the eye, and also having the proper physical dimensions to\nhold each size and denomination of coins in a pattern of its own. Simi-\nlarly planned trays house the various sections of Canadian colonial and\nprovincial tokens. In one of them will be found the Colonial 1822 coins\nand all the issues of the various provinces of the time. I might explain\nthat these coin trays hold the coins in place by separators glued in with\naeroplane glue. These may be removed or altered with very little trouble,\nthe separators used being the balsa wood used for model aeroplanes. A\ntray filled with the silver \u201cEcu of France\u201d, in rigid straight rows, lacked\nthe look of distinction and effectiveness achieved with the \u201cCanadian\u201d\ntrays. However, in common with many collectors I know, most of my\ncollection lacks proper setting and order. A large paper-weight of clear\nplastic containing a 1953 silver dollar adorns my dresser. This was pre-\nsented to me by the Chartered Trust Company, in appreciation for services\nrendered.\n\nThere are, of course, many ways of housing coins, especially one\nwhich I intentionally left for last. This is the 22 coin envelope of kraft\nor white paper, to hold individual coins. This, in my estimation, doesn\u2019t\nlend itself very well to examining or displaying ; however, it is excellent\nfor protecting the coins when kept in boxes. Coin holders are primarily\nintended for coins to be carried away from home to the Club, etc., but\nthe truth is that a collection of coins is usually not mobile and for that\nreason, it is more effectively stored away and displayed in the trays of\na coin cabinet. \u2018It is a natural inclination for most of us to show others\nour collections and it should be possible to examine these with a mini-\nmum of inconvenience.\n\nawn 96\n",
    "91": "History of Coins\nby Dr. J. S. Witxinson\n\nA lecture on \u201cCoin Collecting\u201d delivered in a museum appreciation course\nat the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, 28th of November, 1955\n\n(Continued from March issue.)\n\nThe silver shekel corresponded to\nthe English shilling and like the\ngold coin, showed the king as a\nwarrior. These coins were minted\nby the million and became the first\ncoinage with a really widespread\ncirculation. Sicilian peasants still\nunearth them while ploughing and\nvery worn specimens still circulate\nin the bazaars of Kabut and\nPeshawar.\n\nCoins similar to the first Lydian\nones were issued in the seventh\ncentury B.C. by Miletus, Ephesus,\nPhocaea, Chios and, probably,\nSamos.\n\nThese cities had various devices\non their early coins but each soon\nsettled on a distinctive civic badge.\nThat of Miletus was a lion with its\nhead turned back. Ephesus coin-\nage was symbolized by a bee.\n\nPhocaea used a punning type \u2014\na seal. Chios displayed a seated\nsphinx with curled wings, a creature\nfamiliar in Minoan art.\n\nThe blazon of Samos was a\nlion\u2019s scalp.\n\nThe Museum has an assortment\nof these early issues; of the first\nhundred years of coinage.\n\nThe island of Aegina, near\nAthens, was the first place in Greece\nproper to issue coins. Aegina was\nlong a great maritime power and\n\nher coins carried a sea-turtle as an\n\nappropriate badge until 404 B.C.\n\nAt that time she had been\nconquered by Athens and her sea\npower greatly reduced. It is not\nknown whether the loss of sea\npower was the reason but, from\nthis time on, the coins featured a\nland-tortoise.\n\nThe coinage of Aegina enjoyed a\nwide circulation and was the only\nthe Peloponnesus until the time of\nrecognized medium of exchange in\nthe Persian war. The Peloponnesus\nhad neither copper nor gold mines\nbut was rich in iron, so iron bars\nwere used as currency before the\nintroduction of coinage there.\n\u201cObol\u201d was the name for a rough\niron spit and the number of these\nheld in one hand, literally \u2014 the\ngraspful \u2014was known as \u201cDrach-\nme\u201d. \u2018These names were carried\nover to the coinage as units of\nweight \u2014 six obols being equal to\none drachma \u2014 and the latter term\nhas persisted to date, in Greece as\na unit of money, and in Anglicized\nform \u2014dram\u2014in several weight\nsystems.\n\nCorinth followed Aegina in coin-\ning money, using the divine horse,\nPegasus, as its emblem. Legend\nclaims that Bellerophon captured\nthe horse on the Acrocorinth so it\nmade a local symbol but it is strange\n\not BO 3\n",
    "92": "that Aphrodite, the goddess of\nCorinth, received such secondary\nrecognition on the coins. Corin-\nthian coins from 625-500 B.C. had\na swastika on the back. After\n500 B.C. this side of the coin some-\ntimes featured Aphrodite but more\nusually had a head of Athene\nChalinitis (the bridler), so-called\nbecause tradition held that Athene\nhad helped Bellerophon to capture\nPegasus. The attractive and often\nbeautiful head of Athene wearing\na helmet tilted back was frequently\ncopied by the many colonies of\nCorinth. It was also copied by the\nBritish for the helmet of Britannia\nand by the designers of the badge\nfor the Canadian Women\u2019s Army\nCorps.\n\nAthens commenced issuing coins\nsome years later than Aegina. At\nfirst there was a variety of types but\nthese were soon reduced to a\nhelmeted head of Athene on one\nside and an owl and olive twig on\nthe other. Many Athenian coins\nare attractive and well-struck but\nthe Athenian coinage does not\nmaintain the artistic pre-eminence\nreached by the city in other art\nforms. The coins of Athens circu-\nlated as far away as India and the\nworld markets so won were too\nvaluable to jeopardize by any\nchanges that might affect recogni-\ntion. However, the dependable\nsilver quality and weight of the\nAthenian coins established them as\nan almost international currency.\n\nAthens struck coins in a very\nlarge number of denominations.\nThe standard coin for large com-\nmercial transactions was the tetra-\n\ndrachm \u20144 drachms. For a few\nyears around 485 B.C. Athens\ndistributed among its citizens the\nannual profits from a rich vein in\nthe state-owned silver mines. To\nfacilitate distribution of ten drachms\nper person it coined ten-drachm and\ntwo-drachm pieces.\n\nThe ordinary commodities used\nby the citizens were inexpensive so\nthere were many smaller denomina-\ntions, the smallest of which were\nordinarily carried in the owner's\nmouth.\n\nIn his play, \u201cThe Wasp\u201d, Aristo-\nphanes tells of two jurymen, each\nentitled to three obols for the day\u2019s\nservice, being paid one drachm\nbetween them. One of them\nchanged the coin at a fish shop and\nquickly laid down three mullet\nscales which the other, thinking\nthem to be obols, promptly popped\ninto his mouth. This will give an\nidea as to how tiny the smaller\ncoins were, as there were coins for\nfractions of the obol down to one-\neighth. The coin for 3/8ths of an\nobol, very minute in size, had the\ndisproportionately large name of\ntrihemitetartemorion.\n\nThe smallest of these coins were\nimpractical to make and they were\nreplaced by copper coins, much to\nthe annoyance of the fishwives who\ncomplained that their mouths were\nso filled by the coins that they\ncouldn\u2019t talk.\n\nThe present-day value of an\n\nAthenian silver drachm is ten cents\n\nbut Dr. Wallace points out that\nthe average day\u2019s pay in Athens in\nthe 5th century B.C. was one\n\na 7%\n",
    "93": "drachm. Nowadays, a correspond-\ning rate of pay would be about ten\ndollars.\n\nOn that basis, a hemitetartemo-\nrion, equal to 1/48th of a drachm,\nwould have had a purchasing power\nof about twenty cents.\n\nFluctuations in commodity values\nmake it very difficult to assess buy-\ning power. In the 5th century B.C.\nwhen an Athenian silver drachm\nwould buy 40 cents worth of gold\nat to-day\u2019s value, one-sixth of a\ndrachm was th eallowance given to\na citizen for attending the Assem-\nbly. A century later, a silver drachm\nwould buy 50 cents worth of gold\nbut the assemblyman\u2019s allowance\nhad to be raised sixfold.\n\nThe island of Euboea, near\nAthens, possessed two cities, Chalcis\nand Eretria, which were the most\nenterprising of all in European\nGreece during the 8th and 7th\ncenturies B.C. This is proven by\nthe large number of colonies they\n\nfounded on the coasts of Thrace,\nof Southern Italy and of Sicily.\nEuboea gave her name to one of\nthe most widely used ancient\nweight-standards for precious met-\nals. This island is now the\nundisputed numismatic province of\nDr. W. P. Wallace, Professor of\nAncient History at University Col-\nlege. His collection of Euboean\ncoins comprises about half of all\nthe known surviving specimens.\nDr. Wallace has written many\nscholarly and informative articles\non Greek coins and the American\nNumismatic Society will soon issue\nhis book on the Coinage of the\nEuboean League.\n\nThe Euboean cities of Carystus,\nChalcis, Eretria and Histaca, as well\nas the Euboean League, issued\nvaried, beautiful and often distin-\nguished coins. One of the most\nsuccessful decorative designs in\ncoinage is the octopus used by\nEretria as a civic badge.\n\n(to be continued)\n\nCNA. Chapters and Club Keports\n\nCHAPTER +1 (Ottawa, Ont.) had seventeen members and four\nguests present on March 12th at its third monthly meeting for 1956.\nSince there had not been time, following Major S. S. Carroll\u2019s February\ntalk on Canadian paper currency, for him to answer questions, members\nand guests were invited to bring up pertinent matters for discussion on\nthe present occasion. Mr. G. R. L. Potter confirmed that the Head\nOffice of the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Toronto has an excellent\ndisplay of paper money, adding that visits by appointment are welcomed\nthere.

    "115": "Editor's Page\n\nAt a recent sitting of Parliament, a member objected to the\nappearance of what he claims looks like the face of the devil on our paper\ncurrency. This is caricatured, in the coiffure of Queen Elizabeth whose\nportrait appears on all our bank bills. The Bank of Canada had already\nbeen advised of the \u201cface\u201d and steps are being taken to eliminate it from\nthe Queen\u2019s hair. However, it will take some time before the newly\nengraved notes are in circulation as currency is stockpiled to \u201cripen\u201d for\nat least nine months.\n\nMaundy money is given to the aged by the Queen in an ancient\nceremony on the day before Good Friday, the day that commemorates\nthe Last Supper. As the Queen is 30 this year, 30 old men and 30 elderly\nwomen, as many of each as our monarch\u2019s age, were chosen as recipients.\n\nQueen Elizabeth gave each woman a green purse containing\n\u00a31.15.\u2014; and each man a white purse containing \u00a32.5.\u2014, as clothing\nallowance in lieu of the cloth donated in times gone by.\n\nThe Queen then presented each of the 60 elderly folk with a red\npurse containing \u00a32.10.\u2014 each. She finally gave each of them other\nwhite purses containing the specially minted Maundy money, 30 pence\nin each made up of 1, 2, 3, and 4 pence silver pieces. The Maundy\nmoney is the only British coinage that is still made of silver. The 1946\nregular issue coins were the last to contain any silver whatsoever.\n\nIt has been announced that \u201crubber money\u201d will be in use in Paris,\nOntario, during the Centennial celebrations, June 30th to July 4th. They\nshould be interesting items as oddities, but we should remember that\ntubber will tarnish our coins, even at a distance.\n\nThe Canadian Government has finally removed all controls on gold.\nGold bars and ingots or bullion may now be owned by Canadian\nresidents, the only requisite being one\u2019s power to purchase. There have\nnever been any restrictions on the holding or hoarding of gold coins in\nCanada although controls have been imposed on the owning of gold\ncoins in most countries.\n\nMr. John M. Zidlick states that the name \u201cCanadian Specimen set\nin Mint Condition\u201d has stood us in good stead in the past to describe\nthe early mint sets; he suggests we continue using it in future.\n\nThe British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) proof sets are\nbeautifully executed and attractively housed in a red plush holder in a\nmaroon case. The seven coins are the 1/2 cent, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents,\n10 cents, 25 cents, and 50 cents. These are the first proof sets minted by\nthe Royal Mint since the Coronation issues.\n\n= WF\n",

Probably issued by the\ncounterfeiters who struck many of\nthe anonymous pieces issued about\n\npiece at Rarity 5\u2014$50 to $100.\nTo-day the piece is catalogued at\n$30 to $65.\n\nThere is another variety of these\ncontemporary counterfeits which is\nnot as well known but is nonethe-\nless interesting. It bears a date\nthat appears to be 1882. Before\n\nwas OD nc,\n",
    "118": "considering this piece further it\nmight be worthwhile to look back\nat the history of the early Nova\nScotian penny and_halfpenny\ncoinage.\n\nA coinage of copper halfpence\nwas proposed for Nova Scotia in\n1817, and an act was passed specify-\ning that the design should be taken\nfrom the Great Seal of the province,\nbut the act failed to receive Royal\nAssent. However, the Nova Scotia\nlegislature took matters into its\nown hands and had struck at\nBirmingham, without the authority\nof the Home Government, a series\nof pennies and halfpennies from\n1823 to 1843. The first issue, of\n1823 and 1824, bears a_ poorly\nexecuted bust of George IV. The\n1832 issue bears the same portrait\nalthough William IV_ had : been\nreigning for two years.\n\nAs far as is known only the\n1832 pennies and halfpennies were\ncounterfeited and there are so\nmany varieties of these that it\nwould appear that they were either\ncounterfeited over a considerable\nperiod of time or else there were\nseveral counterfeiters. The coun-\nterfeits are usually of lighter weight\nand struck from lighter. coloured\nbronze than the genuine pieces.\nCourteau lists seven varieties of the\n1832 counterfeit halfpennies and\nMcLachlan lists eight.\n\nCourteau believed that the reverse\nof the variety dated 1882 was struck\nfrom the same die as the rare\nvariety dated 1382. His notes are\nas follows: \u201cThis reverse is from the\n\nsame die as that of the preceding -\n\nnumber after the date had been\n\nchanged to 1832 and the leaves\nretouched. On good specimens a\nfaint line, representing the top of\nthe figure 3, can be seen under\nthe 8, and the new cut 3 has\nretained a little the form of an 8.\nThis explains that at first glance\nthe date of this variety reads 1882.\nThe scarcity of the erroneous date\nand the comparatively high prices\nobtained for good specimens have\ninduced some unscrupulous specu-\nlator to alter the date of this piece,\nso that it appears to be 1382. The\nimposition is easily detected, the\ngenuine 1382 is always found with\nthe \u201cstraight ribbon\u201d obverse, and\nthe 3 in the date is old style, that\nis, it has a square top. I have in\nmy collection a copy of this imposi-\ntion which, though poorly done,\ncan be passed to young collectors\nas genuine.\u201d Presumably, by \u201cgen-\nuine 1382\u201d Courteau means a\ngenuine counterfeit as opposed to\nan altered counterfeit.\n\nThe piece bearing the date which\nappears to be 1882, is scarce but\nnot rare. It turns up with fair\nfrequency and respectable specimens\ncan be picked up for a dollar or so.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBreton, P.

The convention is to be\nheld in the Hotel London, on Friday and Saturday the 21 and 22 of\nSeptember. Ample accommodation will be available. A large display of\nbills, coins and medals from the collections of local Club members is\nplanned, and it is also hoped to exhibit some of the Canadian rarities\nmade available from other sources.\n\nThe London Club is very progressive and is in the centre of a field\nwhere live hundreds of active collectors who have never been members of\nany Club. For the special benefit of these, it is hoped that a showing of\nsome French Regime card and other paper money can be secured for\ndisplay.\n\nThe local Y.M.C.A. holds a Hobby Fair each year in which coin\ncollections owned and assembled by junior collectors are a prominent\nfeature. The London Club helps the Fair in many ways, and will extend\na special invitation to the children to attend an early meeting at which\nthey will be warmly welcomed. In this way a large new group of collectors\nwill be given constructive advice and direction, and the Club may look\nforward to many new members in succeeding years.\n\nThe London Club plans to make this convention stand out and set\nnew high standards. Numismatics is advancing so fast that every effort\nput forth by the Club will be rewarding and bear fruit that all may enjoy.\n\nBourse tables will be available and, if possible, the general program\nwill be drawn up so that collectors may dicker for coins to their heart\u2019s\ncontent and not miss any convention program features.\n\nMr. J.

Remick III\n\n1875-H \u2014 5 Cents. _Two varieties of this coin have been noticed,\neach marked by several distinct characteristics which are apparent on the\ncoins of this date in any condition. On one type the \u201cD\u201d in DEI is\nslightly lower than the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, and the lettering around the Queen\u2019s\nbust is slightly but noticeably larger. The other type shows even lettering\nin DEI, a perfect H, and slightly smaller lettering around Queen\nVictoria\u2019s bust.\n\nThe easiest way to recognize the two variations is by the difference\nin the perfection of the H mint mark and the eveness of the lettering\nin DEI. The difference in the size of the lettering is apparent but not\ngreat so the two varieties must be held side by side in order to distinguish\nthe difference.\n\nOf eight copies examined only two showed the imperfect H, low \u201cD\u201d\nin DEI, and larger lettering, which would seem to indicate that it is the\nscarcer of the two.\n\n1884 \u2014 5 Cents. There is a variation of this coin and it has to do\nwith the placing of the 4 in the date. The one has evenly spaced digits\nin the date while the other has the 4 closer to the 8 than is required by\neven spacing of numerals.\n\n1887 \u201410 Cents. There is a variation in the position and size of\nthe 7 on this coin. There-is the evenly spaced date with uniform numerals\non one while the other has a larger 7 which extends above the 188 and\nis also closer to the 8. This latter type is considered the imperfect one\nand probably the scarcer of the two.\n\n1871-H \u2014 25 Cents. Variation of position of mint mark H: one\nwell centred, the other nearer ribbon.\n\n1874-H \u2014 25 Cents. Variation of the size of the 7 in date.

    "121": "History of Coins\nby Dr. J. S. Witxrnson\n\nA lecture on \u201cCoin Collecting\u201d delivered in a museum appreciation course\nat the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, 28th of November, 1955\n\n(Continued from April issue.)\n\nIn the Peloponnesus, there was\nyery limited coinage down to the\ntime of the Persian wars. In the\nnext two hundred years there were\na large number of active mints of\nwhich the most distinguished were\nElis at Olympia and Argos. The\nsilver coins of Elis struck for the\nOlympic festivals display a variety\nof treatment and a high artistic\nability never exceeded in European\nGreece. The die-engravers were\ntop rank but the mint-operatives\nwere so careless that hardly any\nof the surviving coins show all of\nboth types on both sides.\n\nThe coins of Argos, 421-322 B.C.\nare among the most beautiful in\nGreece, as might be expected from\nthe high standing of Argos as a\nschool of art.\n\nMagna Graecia is a name applied\nto South Italy and Sicily to cover\nthe Greek colonies in that area.\nThe first-known use of the name\nwas by Timaeus who wrote in the\nfirst half of the third century B.C.\n\nHe quotes the proverb \u201cCommon\nare the goods of Friends\u201d, and then\nadds \u201cThis was said in Magna\nGraecia in the days when Pythag-\noras persuaded those dwelling there\nto possess all in common\u201d. The\nbrilliant philosopher-mystic came\nto Croton in Italy as an exile\nduring the second half of the sixth\ncentury B.C. and reformed the\n\nconstitution. There were Pythag-\norean brotherhoods in various South\nItalian cities at that time and it\nis thought that Pythagoras was\nresponsible for the unique form of\nthe early coins of Magna Graecia.\n\nThese coins were impractically\nthin and correspondingly large in\ndiameter. The face of the coins\nwere normal except for a cable\nborder more common on gems and\nfound on no other contemporary\ncoins. The back of the coins\npresents the most unusual feature\n\u2014the design is in intaglio and\nusually repeats the other side of the\ncoin so that it sometimes appears\nas though one were looking at the\nback of the device shown there.\n\nIt is suggested that these coins\nwere designed by Pythagoras to\nexemplify his philosophy of oppo-\nsites in which the right, the upper\nand the front were good while the\nleft, the lower and the back were\nbad.\n\nCoins of this type were issued at\nCroton, Sybaris, Siris, Pyxos, Meta-\npontum, Tarentum, Caulonia, Rhe-\ngium, Zancle and Poseidonia. While\nsome of the designs are grotesque\nthe whole series is fascinatingly\ndifferent from all other coins.\n\nSome of them show great ingenu-\nity where the design on the back is\ndifferent from that on the front\n\n\u2014 103 \u2014\n",
    "122": "and yet fits perfectly into the\nconcave surface of the coin. An\nexample is the coin of Metapontum\nwith an ear of barley on the\n\u201cconvex\u201d side of the coin and a\nbull\u2019s head on the \u201cconcave\u201d side.\nBy an optical illusion, if one looks\nat the intaglio bull\u2019s head for a\nwhile, it seems to come out as\nthough in relief.\n\nCroton, renowned for its strong\nmen, chose the emblems of victory\nat the Olympic Games, usually the\nprize tripod of bronze, for the face\nof the coin. The other side of the\ncoin often has an eagle very cleverly\nworked into the incuse design.\nStrangely, the form of this stylized\neagle is almost exactly the same as\nthe form of the \u201cthunderbird\u201d as\ncarved and hammered out of silver\nby the North American Indians.\n\nThe Pythagorean brotherhoods\nwere broken up early in the fifth\ncentury B.C. and these peculiar\ncoins were replaced with coins of\nmore normal appearance, often\nwith the previous emblems.\n\nThe coins of Caulonia represent a\nmythological mystery. Across the\nfield of the coin strides an Egyptian-\nlooking god; on his outstretched\narm is poised an active imp waving\na branch of leaves as he runs down\nthe god\u2019s biceps. One suggestion\nis that the god is Apollo represented\nhere as the Purifier, Katharsios, and\nthe smaller figure is Typhon, a\nwind spirit who brings healing for\nmalaria and fevers by his cooling\nbreath.\n\nPoseidonia, now known to us as\nPaestum, places its own sea-god,\n\nPoseidon, on its coins. He is shown\nstriding across the field of the coin,\nhurling a trident at some unseen\nfoe.\n\nMetapontum, now a waste of\nsandy scrub but once a very wealthy\nagricultural area, used a head of\nbarley as its main device. On the\nother side of the coin there is often\nan attractive female head, some-\ntimes Demeter but more often\nPersephone, the \u201cmaiden\u201d (Kore).\n\nAnother variety during the period\nof finest art shows the helmeted\nprofile of a local hero, Leukippos.\n\nSybaris was a wealthy city where\nluxury was so sought after that we\nstill use the expression \u201csybarite\u201d\nto describe a person devoted to\nluxury and pleasure. The coins\nshow a well-fed, placid-looking bull,\nso large that he can only be fitted\non the coin by turning his head to\nlook over his flanks. Sybaris was\ndestroyed in 510 B.C. and when\nrebuilt by Athens in 443 B.C. it\nwas called Thurium. The coins of\nthe new city have a bull on the\nreverse, a strong arrogant animal,\ngenerally charging viciously with a\nlowered head. In the period of\nfinest art, the face of the coin bears\nthe head of Athene wearing a\ntichly adorned helmet, generally\nwith a figure of Scylla.\n\nVelia and Herakleia also used a\nhelmeted head of Athene, the\nformer usually having a lion on the\nother side whereas Herakleia usually\nhad a figure of Heracles, often\nwrestling with a lion. The coins of\nthese cities, particularly Herakleia,\nreached a very high level of beauty.\n\n\u2014 104 \u2014\n",
    "123": "The Scylla depicted on so many of\nthe helmets of these coins is not\nthe horrible monster described by\nHomer \u2014a creature with 12 feet,\n6 long necks with ugly heads with\nthree rows of teeth. The Scylla\nshown is a later one described by\nOvid, (quote) \u201cHer dreadful paunch\nsurrounded by fierce dogs, having\nthe face of a virgin and (if the poets\nhave not left us all things wrapped\nup in fiction) she was for some\ntime actually a virgin\u201d (unquote).\nOn the coins she is very attractive\ndown to the waist and is usually\nrepresented as throwing stones or\nbrandishing a trident.\n\nThe coins of Terina are among\nthe most beautiful of those issued\nby the Greeks in Italy. The face\nof the coin usually bears a female\nhead with various elaborate coif-\nfures. The reverse usually depicts\na winged maiden often resembling\nthe angels of renaissance art.\n\nNeapolis produced many coins in\na range of denominations but the\nartistic skill of her die-engravers\nwas noticeably lower than that of\nmany of her contemporaries.\n\nTarentum claimed to have been\nfounded by Taras who once was\nrescued from drowning by a dol-\nphin. Therefore, the chief type on\nthe long series of Tarentine coins\nshows Taras riding on a dolphin.\nAfter 436 B.C. the back of the\ncoin showed a horseman, some-\ntimes a warrior and sometimes a\njockey. The designers achieved an\namazing variety of types using these\nsame subjects. There is one charm-\ning coin showing a boy mounted\non a horse while another boy is\n\napparently removing some irritating\nobject from one hoof of the horse.\n\nRhegium adopted the lion\u2019s mask\nof Samos, as many of its citizens\nhad been forced to migrate from\nthere. On the best specimens, this\nis one of the most successful\ndesigns, presenting a lively and\ngrimly humorous effect.\n\nSyracuse, a Corinthian colony in\nSicily, achieved a position of power\nand importance during the sixth\ncentury B.C. and maintained it for\nthree centuries. The main type on\nthe coins for all this time was the\nnymph Arethusa who is shown\nwith dolphins swimming around\nher head. Legend states that\nArethusa was a shy nymph who\nfled the ardent wooings of the river\ngod Alpheus. She hurried down\nthe mountain slopes, plunged\nunderwater and emerged only when\nshe reached the safe harbour of\nSyracuse, where the fountain sur-\nvives to this day, its fresh water\nspringing up through the brine.\nThe Syracusan designers, many of\nthem very skilful, designed various\nattractive coiffures for the young\nlady and adorned her with hand-\nsome ear rings and necklaces. The\nrestraint of the Greek artists is\nhighlighted by the copies made by\nCarthaginian artists who substituted\nbangles and grosser ornaments.\n\nThe tetradrachm was the largest\nSyracusan coin ordinarily . struck\nbut, on at least two occasions,\ndekadrachms were struck. The first\ntime was after Gelon of Syracuse\nhad defeated the Carthaginians in\n480 B.C.\u2014the same date as the\nGreek victory over the Persians at\n\n\u2014 105 \u2014\n",
    "124": "Salamis. Some seventy years later,\nto commemorate the defeat of the\nAthenian fleet and the destruction\nof their army at the Assinarius\nRiver, two artists, Euanetos and\nKimon, designed a series of deka-\ndrachms which rank among the\ngreat creations of art in coinage.\nThese coins were used at the\nAssinarian Games held annually to\ncelebrate the Syracusan victory.\n\nThe accompanying type on all\nSyracusan tetradrachms and deka-\ndrachms is a racing chariot drawn\nby two or four horses. At first the\nhorses walked, later when engravers\nhad mastered the problem of the\nhorse\u2019s legs, all superimposed in\nplane upon plane of relief, they\ngallop.\n\nAkragas still stands on a steep\nbluff of rock. Her coin types are\nthe crab and the eagle. Sutherland\nselects as the noblest of all Greek\ncoins the one of Akragas showing\ntwo eagles standing on a hare.\n\nSelinus stood at the junction of\ntwo rivers and in the surrounding\nmarsh grew an abundance of wild\nparsley \u2014 the selinon \u2014 which gave\nthe city its mame. Parsley was\nprized by the Greeks who wove it\ninto chaplets for prizes at the\nIsthmian and Nemean Games.\n\nThe Greeks also used selinon to\nhang in garlands on tombstones,\nand the expression that a person\nwas \u201cready for his parsley\u201d implied\nseriously impaired health. Natu-\ntally, selinon was the chief coin\ntype of the city. About 466 B.C. a\nterrible pestilence broke out in\nSelinus so the people consulted the\n\ngreat scientist Empedocles. He\nrealized that the site was unhealthy\nand turned the two rivers into one\nbed which drained the mosquito-\ninfested swamps. Empedocles was\nnot honoured on the coins which\ngave the credit to Apollo and his\nsister Artemis who are shown riding\nin a triumphal chariot; Artemis\ndriving while Apollo shoots his\narrows at the retreating but invisible\nspirit of disease. \u2018The reverse shows\nan elaborate scene of sacrifice and\nburnt offering.\n\nIn North Africa, the Greeks had\nestablished the cities of Cyrene,\nBarce and Euhesperides (the blessed\nland of the evening star). This\nland of Cyrenaica produced cere-\nals, sheep and horses; camels, slaves,\ndates and gold dust were brought\nfrom the interior of Libya but\nsilphium always has the place of\nhonour on the coins. This plant\nis extinct but Theophrastus and\nPliny state that the juice of the\nstem, the roots, leaves and fruit\nwere valued for medicinal purposes.\nThe flowers were used for perfume,\nlikely a strange and powerful scent,\nfor the plant is believed to have\nbeen a variety of asafoetida.\n\nHowever, it must be remembered\nthat there were no refrigerators in\nthose days, so strong flavours were\nneeded to mask the taste and odour\nof many foods.\n\nThe reverse of the Cyrenaican\ncoins show a fine head of Zeus\nAmmon. The great curling ram\u2019s\nhorns of the Egyptian god Ammon\nare placed upon the head of the\nOlympic Zeus.\n\n(to be continued)\n\n\u2014 106 \u2014\n",

    "143": "A Message from the President\n\nWhen the first number of the Canadian Numismatic Journal\n\nappeared in January last, I wrote, in part:\n\nPublication is, of course, in itself something of a venture,\nand will depend for its success on the continuing support of an\nadequate membership and \u2014 fully as important \u2014 of an adequate\n\nsupply of contributions to fill the pages.\n\nOne factor of prime importance was omitted in this statement,\nperhaps because it seemed so obvious as not to need mentioning. The\nneed for an adequate advertising content was not stressed. It must be\nstressed now. The Journal is running badly behind, in a financial sense,\nand unless the advertising revenue can be brought more in line with the\ncost of publication we shall certainly have to cut down on the number of\npages per issue, and quite probably on the number of issues. This would\n\nbe unfortunate, but we simply cannot continue on the present basis.\n\n' Members generally are therefore urged to do whatever they can to\nremedy this situation. The Journal is published for their benefit. If they\nwish it to continue, more help is needed, and needed quickly.\n\nG. R. L. Porrer,\n\nPresident.\n\nNON-RECEIPT OF JOURNALS\n\nIf members who have failed to receive any numbers of the Journal\nwill advise the undersigned, the missing issues will be forwarded\nimmediately. \u2014G.

    "144": "Editor\u2019s Page\n\nOur C.N.A. Chapters are increasing in number, which is as it should\nbe. At the time of writing, another Chapter is being admitted to the\nAssociation, with further applications pending, including one from the\nsouthern United States. No names are mentioned here, since official\nannouncements of acceptance lie outside of our jurisdiction, but we feel\nsure that the swift growth of the Association will gratify all our friends.\n\nElection reports from the Calgary Chapter show that four of their\nleading officers live in the four principal divisions of that city. We hope\nthese officers are on the best of terms with one another, and that their\ngeographical distribution is merely by coincidence.\n\nSuggestions and comments regarding the Journal are always welcome.\nEvery letter of suggestion or comment is carefully noted, even though it\nmay not be possible to implement all suggestions received, but you may\nbe sure they are all given due consideration and kept for further reference.\nRecently, the most frequent suggestion has to do with the use of illustra-\ntions. We all agree that the idea is excellent, but cost limitations at\npresent preclude the extensive use of illustrations in the Journal. Cuts\nfor this purpose are expensive and would bring the price of our publication\nout of line with what is financially feasible just now. However, with a\nlarger membership and more advertising, illustrations will come in due\ncourse.\n\nThe monthly report of the London Numismatic Society gives clear\nindication that the Third Annual Convention of the C.N.A. should be\nan excellent affair, deserving of support from all members and friends\nwho live in that part of Canada. Anyone who has been there will tell\nyou of the cordial and helpful reception given visitors by Byron Swayze\nand other local numismatists. All C.N.A. members who can arrange to\nspend two days of their holidays at our London Convention, next\nSeptember 21 and 22 (a Friday and Saturday), will find themselves in\none of the most prosperous and beautiful cities of our glorious Dominion.\n\nMr. L. J. P. Brunet has recently been promoted to Assistant\n\u2018Dominion Archivist, and in view of his increased responsibilities he has\nasked to be relieved of his editorial duties with the C.N.A. Mr. A. E. H.\nPetrie, who is associated with him at the Public Archives in Ottawa,\nvery kindly consented to take over as our Assistant Editor. We know\nthat the C.N.A.\u2019s membership will wish to join in extending heartiest\ncongratulations to Mr. Brunet, whose counsels and practical aid have\nmeant so much to our Association from its formative years to the present,\nand we are happy that he is to continue as official Historian. We welcome\nMr. Petrie\u2019s interest and help, and hope to enjoy his cooperation for\nmany years to come. ;\n\n\u2014 122 \u2014\n",

These\nheroes took the salute of the\nRegiment at the opening ceremony.\nOnly once before had a larger group\nof Canadian V.C.s been brought\ntogether in their own homeland.\n\nThe exhibition was well advertis-\ned on TV, radio and in the press,\nboth before the opening and while\nthe event was in progress; because\nof this, and the excellent support\nreceived from the organizing com-\nmittees, the exhibition enjoyed\nwide public attendance.\n\nIt is understood that the Depart-\nment of National Defence may\narrange to hold further public\nshowings of these treasures in\nseveral other centres of the Province\nof Quebec.\n\nHamilton National Coin\nWeek Exhibit\n\nby Miss Thelma PELLerier\n\nThe Hamilton Chapter of the\nC.N.A. exhibited coins in the newly\nopened Royal Bank of Canada, on\nJames Street South, in Hamilton.\n\nOur exhibition included a wide\nvariety of coins, ranging from\nancient Greek and Roman to sets\nof modern Canadian coins. Also\n\nshown were a few pieces in odd\nshapes and sizes, as well as several\nof Biblical interest. The display\nafforded an excellent opportunity to\nview the development and transi-\ntion of coining practices from\nearliest types to present-day varie-\nties, in the two cases displayed.\n\n\u2014 124 \u2014\n",
    "147": "The first case contained 35 an-\ncient and mediaeval coins, along\nwith several curiosities. These were\nselected for their public appeal, and\nhad appropriate captions and labels.\nAmong the ancient pieces were\nexamples of the Athenian tetra-\ndrachm and Persian siglos. To\nillustrate Greek influence on ori-\nental art and by way of comparison,\nthere was a large flat Sassanian\nsilver drachm of Varhanes II (A.D.\n277-294) bearing representations of\ntheir royal family on its obverse.\nAmong the Roman items, a superb\nportrait denarius of Julius Caesar,\nan \u201cOstia\u201d sestertio of Nero and a\ngold solidus of Valentinian ITI were\nof particular numismatic interest.\nThe mediaeval coins were all\nEnglish and accompanied by two\nfull-sized die models to indicate the\nmethods of producing the various\npieces. Noteworthy among the\n\ncuriosities were an example of\nChinese \u201cknife money\u201d, a crude\nbronze of Italy during the 3rd Cen-\ntury B.C., and a great copper\n5-kopeck piece of Russia, beside\nwhich a tiny Nepalese gold morsel\nhad been placed for comparison\nof sizes.\n\nThe second case contained a\ndisplay of Canadian coins, compris-\ning the designs from Queen Victo-\nria to Queen Elizabeth II, including\na few of the scarcer items. A set\nof large cents in a Whitman folder\ndemonstrated an easy way of hous-\ning these. Coronation proofs of\nGreat Britain and of the Union of\nSouth Africa, including the gold,\nwere also shown in their special\ncases. The rest of the exhibition\nconsisted largely of crowns and the\n1797 \u201ccartwheel\u201d penny and two-\npenny of George III.\n\nCNA. Chapters and Club Keports\n\nCHAPTER # 1 (Ottawa) held its May meeting on the 14th of the\nmonth, with an attendance of twenty-five members and guests.\n\nOur speaker on this occasion was Mr. J. Douglas Ferguson, F.R.N.S.,\n\nPast President of the American Numismatic Association and Honorary\nPresident of the C.N.A., who gave an address on Canadian Medals and\nDecorations that provoked much thoughtful discussion. Mr. Ferguson\nillustrated his summary of this unjustly neglected field of numismatics\nwith outstanding specimens from his own collections, including the Order\nof St. Louis and a badge of the Baronetage of Nova Scotia.\n\nBusiness: considered included two designs \u2014 one in silver relief, and\nthe other in enamels \u2014 submitted by Ottawa jewellers for the proposed\nC.N.A. membership pin.\n\nIt was decided that programmes for next Fall as well as the auctioning\nof selected series of Canadian money, would be discussed at our June 11th\ngathering.\n\n\u2014 125 \u2014\n",

Many items of\nbusiness were discussed, including that of running a poll to determine\nif another evening would be more suitable than Sunday for our meetings,\nand the appointment of Messrs. Bruce Brace and Rudy Sauro to the\nexhibit committee for the displays in the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nThe usual trading session followed the end of the meeting.\n\nHamilton Chapter\u2019s sixth meeting of the season took place on\nSunday April 22th with seventeen members in attendance. This was\nrather encouraging, as our attendance has been down for the last few\nmeetings.\n\nPresident Sam Baggs opened the meeting by welcoming Mrs. Shirley\nChristian and Mr. Albert Sentes as new members of our Chapter.\n\nIt has been decided to leave our display in the Royal Bank for another\nweek owing to the public interest and favourable remarks from various\nquarters.\n\nBruce R.

These included collectors from the Rochester, Buffalo, Hamilton,\nLondon and Ottawa Clubs and Chapters, some of them accompanied by\ntheir wives and families. We were happy to have with us once more\nBillie Clarke, the youngest member of the London Numismatic Society,\nand to learn that he is now their Secretary. Good going, Billie! It was\nalso a pleasure to welcome Mr. G. R. L. Potter, President of the C.N.A.,\nhere on a special trip from Ottawa. The business of the meeting was\nshortened so that there might be more opportunity for those present to\nexamine bourses and auction lots, besides allowing more time for meeting\nguests from out of town. Our principal business was the approving of a\nconstitution for the Toronto Coin \u2018Club.\n\nAnnouncement was made that the Club intends to invite the\nAmerican Numismatic Association to hold a convention under our\nauspices in Toronto at an early date.

Winxinson\n\nA lecture on \u201cCoin Collecting\u201d delivered in a museum appreciation course\nat the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, 28th of November, 1955\n\n(Continued from May issue)\n\nIt was at the shrine of this\ncombined deity in an oasis of\nthe Libyan desert that Alexander\nannounced his divine origin and\nclaimed descent from Zeus Ammon.\n\nThe large island of Crete is rich\nin mythological lore and illustrates\nupon its coins the familiar tales of\nEuropa and the bull. Knossos\nsometimes shows the minotaur and\nmany of its coins show the labyrinth.\n\nRhodes produced many attractive\ncoins with the facing head of the\nsun god and on the back, the rose,\nwhich is the meaning of the island\u2019s\nname. \u2018The rose was depicted\nopen, in bud and in various\npatterns, one of which is almost\nidentical with the Tudor rose.\n\nCyprus had a fairly large number\nof mints, and their coins showed\nEgyptian and Assyrian influences in\naddition to some undiluted Greek\ntypes. Cnidus in Caria issued very\nattractive pieces with the forepart\nof a lion on one side and the head\nof Aphrodite on the other. During\nthe fifth century these were the\nmost attractive Greek coins made\nin Asia.\n\nAetolia is the home of Atalanta\nand the scene of the Calydonian\nhunt. Here the favourite types are\nof a local hero, Aetolus, wearing a\nsun hat, or kausia, and on the\nreverse, a snarling Calydonian boar.\n\nPhocis has coins with a bull\u2019s\nhead sometimes bound with a\nsacrificial fillet. \u2018The head of Apollo\nis the reverse type, with a poetic\ntouch \u2014a tiny lyre half-hidden by\nthe god\u2019s curling locks \u2014\u2018\u201c\u2018a lute\nstrung with bright Apollo\u2019s hair\u201d.\n\nLocris Opuntii, so called from its\nchief city \u2014 Opus \u2014 copied the\nArethusa of Euaenetos. The reverse\ndie is also Sicilian in type\u2014an\narmed hero making a_ vigorous\ndefence with his sword and shield\nfacing an unseen foe. The name\nAjax is added to show that it is\ntheir home-town hero of Homeric\nfame.\n\nIn Thessaly, the land was given\nover to the worship of Poseidon,\ncreator of the horse. Larissa displays\na great variety of horses, galloping,\ntrotting or standing proudly at\nease. One small coin of Larissa\nshows a little girl tossing a ball as\nthough she were playing a game of\njacks.\n\nThe Thessalian youths practised\na form of bull-fighting similar to\nthe bulldogging of steers in the\nWest.\n\nAcanthus presents a savage lion\nattacking and overpowering a bull.\nThis primitively cruel scene is a\nvery effective coin device.\n\nThasos and Lete feature a drunk-\nen satyr carrying off a woodland\nnymph. The archaic coins are\n\n\u2014 130 \u2014\n",

One of these, taken from the old\nBank of Western Canada $4.00 note, reproduced the bill\u2019s main features\nwith minor alterations to make it appropriate for the occasion: \u201cRound-\nUp\u201d replaced \u201cBank\u201d, to make the note read \u201cThe Round-Up of Western\nCanada\u201d, while \u201cRegina, Sask., May 20, 1956\u201d was substituted for the\nlower half of the large word \u201cFOUR\u201d. This will serve to remind those\nwho attended of a most happy and memorable occasion.\n\nOn the initiative of Mr. Alexander Watt, the Waterloo County\nCoin Club has been organized recently in Kitchener, Ontario. At their\ninaugural meeting on June 11, each of the seven charter members was\ngiven a $1000 Confederate reprint bill bearing the signatures of all who\nwere present. In the election of officers, Mr. Harvey Brubacher of Pres-\nton became President of the Club and Mr. J. A. Mackenzie their Secre-\ntary-Treasurer.\n\nDespite the rapid growth of interest in Canadian numismatics, our\nAssociation is having an uphill struggle to make ends meet at the present\ntime. This challenge must be faced, and will undoubtedly be overcome.\nIn the meantime, members will understand that these \u201cgrowing pains\u201d,\nattendant upon initial production of the Journal, call for their active\nsupport in such forms as more advertising, and their patience with certain\nprinting and mailing difficulties that have arisen. Every effort is being\nmade to remedy these quite temporary upsets, annoying and unfortunate\nthough they are, so that we solicit the continued loyalty of our advertisers,\nand the indulgence of our membership for any delays or inconvenience\nwhich they may have suffered.\n\nMr. Robert H. Lloyd of North Tonawanda, N.Y., agrees that \u201cstar\u201d\nnotes are quite common, but points out that they should not be consid-\nered oddities or freaks. Printed in large quantities as replacements to\nkeep the note count right, they should be regarded as an integral part\nof the regular issue. This applies, equally, to the production of Canadian\n\u201casterisk\u201d notes.\n\nThe 1936 \u201cdot\u201d dime found recently by a Vancouver housewife is\nreported sold for $600. We believe this to be the coin mentioned in the\ncurrent report from Chapter No. 7.\n\nAnnouncement comes from India of an official change to decimal\ncoinage at the beginning of April, 1957. There are now sixteen annas\nto the rupee, which has a current value of twenty-one Canadian cents;\nthe revised rupee will consist of one hundred units called \u201cnava paisa\u201d,\nor new money. The coin\u2019s legend in Hindi will state its value in rupees\nor fractions thereof.\n\n\u2014 137 \u2014\n",

Proposed\nchanges must be submitted to the Executive at least sixty days pre-\nvious to such meeting, and shall be circulated to the members at least\ntwo weeks before the date of such meeting.\n\nAny member proposing changes or amendments in the Constitu-\n\ntion, therefore, should act in accordance with the above.\n\nIt is regretted\n\nthat it has not yet been possible to get copies of the Constitution into\nthe hands of members, and it is hoped that this may be accomplished\n\nwithin the next week or two.\n\nMr. J. K. Curtis, President of Chapter No. 1, has consented to act\nas chairman of the committee to deal with amendments to the Con-\nstitution, and any communications in this regard should be addressed\nto him at 66 Grove Ave., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWestern Kound- Up of Coin Collectors\nin Kegina, on May 20, 1956\n\nPerfect weather welcomed forty-\nfour visitors as they arrived at the\nDrake Hotel in Regina for the\nfirst Western Round-Up of Coin\nCollectors, sponsored by the Regina\nCoin Club to bring numismatists\ntogether for their first general reu-\nnion in our Great West. Manitoba\nwas well represented, with nine\nguests from Winnipeg. Saskatche-\nwan contributed friends from Avon-\nlea, Duval, Hanley, Punnichy and\nYorkton. From Alberta, there were\nnumismatists of Medicine Hat and\nStandard, and from the East,\nMajor Sheldon S. Carroll of Ottawa,\nfirst President of the C.N.A.\n\nRegistration opened at 9 A.M.\nunder the kind and capable direc-\ntion of Miss Gwen Sentis and Mr.\nDuncan McKellar. After signing\nthe guest book, visitors received\ntheir name cards and ribbons, and\na programme for the day. Two\norchids were pinned upon each of\nthem with the compliments of Mr.\nT. J. Hardie, President of the\nRegina Coin Club; our host had\nhad these gorgeous blooms flown\nin from Hawaii for the occasion.\n\nMr. Nell introduced newcomers\nto those present; the time went\nquickly as we chatted about coins\n\n\u2014 138 \u2014\n",
    "165": "and got acquainted; others looked\nover the Regina members\u2019 splendid\nexhibits or dealt at the four bourse\ntables. Each display was distincti-\nvely presented. Mr. Tannahill, for\nexample, showed his outstanding\ncollection of Canadian tokens, \u2014\nmore than four hundred of them,\nincluding many rarities. Items of\nspecial interest included a North\nWest Company token, the Hudson\nBay set, the Colonial coins, a Less-\nlie twopence, the Bank of Mont-\nreal side-view penny and half-penny,\nas well as a number of French\nRegime and other choice pieces. It\nwas a real pleasure for all present\nto have the opportunity of seeing\nthese gems; Mr. Tannahill\u2019s collec-\ntion is rated one of the best in\nWestern Canada.\n\nMr. Duncan of Hanley, Sask.,\ndisplayed notable crowns of the\nworld from his collection of nearly\nfour hundred. Miss Sentis, now a\nresident of California, had a gene-\nral selection featuring gold, silver\nand copper proofs of several coun-\ntries, coins of Edward VIII and a\nmedal of his reign, Maundy sets,\nand a group of Canadian five dollar\ngold pieces, all most attractively\nmounted. Mr. Nell exhibited the\ncomplete range of Canadian silver\ndollars in Whitman folders. Mr.\nHardie brought many examples\nfrom his extensive gold collection,\nincluding all of the Canadian five\nand ten dollar gold coins, the two\ndollar pieces of Newfoundland, Uni-\nted States Indian Head quarter-\neagles, the 1887 Jubilee set of Great\nBritain in proof, and various foreign\ncoins. In addition, he had some\nrare Canadian tokens, a 1921 five\ncent piece, and a very fine speci-\n\nmen of the 1936 \u201cdot\u201d cent. Mr.\nWatts drew attention with his four\nsuperb coronation medals, among\nthem a large silver medal of 1937\nin its red leather case. Mr. Haddad\nplaced on view gold coins and paper\nmoney of Newfoundland, Cana-\ndian, United States and foreign\ngold, as well as Canadian federal\nand chartered bank notes.\n\nFollowing an excellent luncheon,\nautomobiles took us for a tour of\nthe R.C.M.P. Training Centre. In\ntheir auditorium we saw two films\nentitled \u201cDoubtful Dollars\u201d and\n\u201cKnow Your Money\u201d, both well\ndone and demonstrating modern\nmethods of detecting counterfeit\nmoney. We were then conducted\nby R.C.M.P. courier to their Mu-\nseum, famous for its souvenirs of\nthe early West. Here we had a\nfascinating time inspecting firearms,\nuniforms and various objects asso-\nciated with Louis Riel, the \u201cMad\nTrapper\u201d Johnson and many others.\nOne centre of attention was a case\ncontaining counterfeit coins and\nnotes, along with the equipment\nused in producing them. In the\nChapel we saw their famous stained\nglass windows, two at the front\nrepresenting members of the Force\nin their bright red jackets. Next,\nwe visited the stables, where the\ngleaming black horses used for\nMusical Rides were a joy to behold.\nThere was great enthusiasm over\nthe beauty and cleanliness of both\nhorses and stables. After this bra-\ncing and enjoyable experience, we\nall returned to the Hotel, where\ngroup photographs were taken.\n\nOur Banquet began at five in the\nafternoon.

Lucky tickets were drawn\nfor five uncirculated coin prizes\ndonated by some of our hosts. As\na memento of the occasion, hand-\nsome crocheted slippers donated by\nMr. Tannahill were presented to\nall ladies in attendance. A charm-\ning novelty doll, \u201cQueen of the\nRound-Up\u201d, the gift of Mrs. Watts,\nwas won by Mrs. Christensen of\nStandard, Alberta.\n\nMr. Tannahill, C.N.A. Director\nfor the Prairie Provinces, thanked\nall those attending this first reunion\nin the Canadian West, and hoped\nthat it had been enjoyed sufficiently\nto warrant making it an annual\nevent. Since this was a new expe-\nrience for all concerned, he hoped\nthat any oversights might be ex-\ncused and that the general spirit\nof friendship would remain as a\nhappy memory. We were particu-\nlarly delighted to have so many\nC.N.A. members from Winnipeg,\nas it gave much encouragement to\nthe Regina organizers; by the same\ntoken, we regretted that the Calgary\nand Edmonton Clubs had no repre-\nsentatives present.\n\nMajor Sheldon S. Carroll, first\nPresident of the C.N.A., was invi-\nted to address the gathering: a\nsummary of his remarks will be\nfound in this number of the Journal.\nNext to speak was Mr. W. A.\nNoviski of Medicine Hat, Alberta,\nfirst C.N.A. Director for the Prairie\nProvinces. He said, in part: \u201cI am\ncertainly glad of the opportunity\nto meet so many collectors here,\n\nand extend thanks to those respon-\nsible for bringing this about. This\nhas been an enjoyable occasion; I\nhope that it will become an annual\nevent where collectors have a\nchance to get together and discuss\ncoins, and see such displays as we\nhave seen today.\u201d Mr. Vincent,\nPresident of the Manitoba Coin\nClub, then told the gathering that\nhe was pleased by his Club\u2019s turn-\nout, thanked the Regina Coin Club\non behalf of his members for initia-\nting the Round-Up and hoped that\nwhen their turn came Winnipeg\nmight do as well. Mr. H. E.\nSampson, senior member of the\nRegina Coin Club, told his listeners\nabout some of the medals in his\ncollection, \u2014 one of them an award\nto a seaman on Nelson\u2019s Flagship\n\u201cVictory\u201d for heroism at the Battle\nof Trafalgar, another given at the\ntime of the Riel Rebellion.\n\nSubsequently, a floor and mail\nauction was conducted by Mr. Tan-\nnahill, with Mr. Latta as clerk. The\nmost interesting item, a 1921 Cana-\ndian half dollar, was sold privately\nlater.\n\nWe were pleased to learn that\nMr. Noviski has a second hobby, \u2014\nshooting movies. Throughout the\nday he was busy in various positions\nand places with his little camera,\ntrying to get all present into one\nor more films. If these turn out\nwell, he will make them available\nfor viewing to the C.N.A. regional\ngroups, after suitable titles have\nbeen added.\n\nThe event concluded, many hur-\nried off to catch their trains, while\n\n\u2014 140 \u2014\n",
    "167": "others stayed to chat a little longer.\nIt was obvious that everyone had\nhad a thoroughly good time, and\n\nall of us look forward to the next\nWestern Round-Up in May, 1957.\n\nMartin M. Warts,\n\nSecretary,\nRegina Coin Club.\n\nSummary of Major S.S. Carroll\u2019s Address\nto the Western Kound - Up in Regina\non May 20, 1956\n\nI have several reasons for being\npleased today, \u2014 first of all, because\nI realize how much conventions of\nthis kind mean to collectors, to the\nwelfare of local clubs and to the\nwell-being of the Canadian Numis-\nmatic Association. I have expe-\nrienced Western hospitality before,\nbut never quite like what I have\nencountered here today. It has\nbeen magnificent.\n\nBefore going any further, I must\nexpress to you the personal regards\nand best wishes of Mr. Potter and\nthe other officers of the Canadian\nNumismatic Association. For many\nreasons it was impossible for them\nto come, so I have been asked to\nrepresent them. Mr. Potter asked\nme to express to you his very best\nwishes and his regrets that he was\nunable to attend. Last week I had\na very enjoyable time in the com-\npany of Mr. Ferguson. He also\nasked me to convey to you his very\nbest personal regards.\n\nNow, gatherings of this kind do\nmore than anything else to promote\nunity among numismatists. I have\nbeen collecting coins for about\ntwenty-five years, and that is noth-\ning compared to some of the others.\n\nI started in a small town; I had\nnever seen a catalogue, and did not\nknow there were magazines pu-\nblished about numismatics. It took\nme a long time to find out these\nthings. Many a time I wished that\nthere was a local club, or a national\nassociation. I had heard about the\nAmerican Numismatic Association,\nbut it was concerned primarily with\nAmerican coins. Ever since, I have\nhad two great wishes: one, that\nthere might be a Canadian Numis-\nmatic Association, and this has now\nbeen fulfilled; the other, that we\ncould arouse as great an interest\namong American collectors o ver\nthe Canadian series as existed years\nago. Some of the finest collections\nof Canadian coins and tokens were\nformed in the United States by\nAmerican collectors about the be-\nginning of this century.\n\nIn Canada, Canadian numisma-\ntics had its heyday in the latter\npart of the 19 Century. There\nwere several coin societies in the\nEast: Ottawa and Montreal were\namong the first to organize such\ngroups in North America. How-\never, interest among Canadian\ncollectors fell off badly during the\nSecond World War, and several of\n\noe\n",
    "168": "the societies folded. When I set-\ntled in Ottawa after the War, I\nfound that there were four numis-\nmatists meeting once a month. Mr.\nL. J. P. Brunet, our immediate past\nPresident, was the one who started\nthe first gatherings. The others\nwere Mr. Potter, Mr. James Hector\n\u2014 the first collector to note the\nCanadian \u201cdot\u201d coinage and Mr.\nMaurice Lafortune. I got in touch\nwith them, and asked to join. The\ngroup grew to seven or eight, and\nwe decided to form a club. In that\nway, we could get some publicity:\nthe news would appear in the paper,\nand we were fortunate to receive\ncoverage from both the local news-\npapers, the Ottawa Citizen and the\nOttawa Journal. I was the first\nSecretary of the Ottawa Coin Club.\n\nThere was no looking back, for\nsoon we had some 25 members.\nMany people from outside sent in\nenquiries about joining our group.\nNotices were sent to The Numisma-\ntist. The Numismatic Scrapbook\nMagazine and Seaby\u2019s Bulletin. We\nsoon found that there were more\nmembers outside Ottawa than in\nthe city itself. So, it was decided\nto reorganize as the Canadian Nu-\nmismatic Association. I had the\npleasure of serving as President of\nthe Canadian Numismatic Associa-\ntion during its first thre\u00e9 years.\nThey were not very glorious, but\ncertainly most interesting.\n\nWe decided to publish a bulletin.\nFortunately, there were facilities for\nmimeographing in my office, and\nthat is where the first issues of\nthe C.N.A. Bulletin were run off.\nDuring its first year all the officers\nwere Ottawa men, and we held a\n\nmeeting each time a Bulletin was\ndue; we would walk around a table\npicking up page 1, 2, 3 and so on,\nstaple them together, address and\nstamp them for the mail; these were\nour executive meetings. After a\nwhile, we were able to let the job\nout. The Bulletin proved a great\naid to Canadian numismatics.\n\nWe are now one of the largest\nNumismatic Associations in the\nworld, all this having been accom-\nplished since the Second World\nWar. I think we can be proud of\nour latest venture, The Canadian\nNumismatic Journal, and there is\nsome reason to hope that the time\nis approaching when advertising will\ncarry a good part of the publication\ncosts.\n\nStill, the most essential factor is\nthat we have strong, active Chapters\nand Clubs, from the West Coast\nto Montreal. Unfortunately, there\nare none in the Maritimes. We\nfind our strength in the Chapters,\nand in affiliated Clubs. The Ame-\nrican Numismatic Association was\nfounded in 1891, but it was not\nuntil the middle Twenties that their\nmembership passed the thousand\nmark, whereas we have passed it in\nabout five years. A large part of\nour membership is drawn from the\nUnited States \u2014 some 40 per cent.\nMany American collectors special-\nized in the United States series and\nhad completed them as far as their\nresources permitted. Since they\nwere looking for something new and\nattractive, the time was ripe for\nintroducing American numismatists\nto another series similar to their\nown, with the same language and\ndenominations, \u2014 the Canadian\n\n\u2014142\u2014\n",
    "169": "series. That, too, has helped to\nmake possible our Association.\n\nOne thing more, \u2014 though this\nis only my personal opinion, \u2014 a\nlot of collectors are missing much\nof the pleasure Canadian numisma-\ntics has to offer when they stop with\nthe decimal series; our currencies\nprior to Confederation are just as\ninteresting. Another fascinating\nfield is that of the tokens. Numis-\nmatics is the science of coins and\nmedals. We have largely neglected\nCanadian medals, yet no section is\nmore completely tied in with Cana-\ndian history than the medals.\n\nMuch has still to be done in\nresearch work and writing. During\nthe Nineteen Twenties Courteau\nwas turning out a number of books,\nmost of which are out of date since\nso much more has been discovered.\nThen, too, books like Breton, Le-\nroux, Frossard\u2019s Franco-American\nJetons and McLachlan\u2019s Commu-\nnion Tokens are too expensive for\nthe majority of collectors, besides\nbeing practically impossible to find.\nWe now need numismatists who\nwill take the time and trouble to\n\ndo the necessary research work re-\nquired for filling out our fund of\ninformation, so that all of us will\nbe able to learn what we should\nknow about Canadian coins, tokens,\nmedals, decorations and paper\nmoney.\n\nI should like to say to you in\nRegina how much we in the East\nappreciate your promotion of this\nsplendid meeting, since it is usually\nimpossible for most of you to get\ndown to the C.N.A. convention in\nthe East. All C.N.A. officers are\nnow from the East, but there is no\nreason why our president should not\ncome from the West; however, that\nwill not occur until you people start\nnominating and electing someone\nfrom the West. In the meantime,\nI should like to say that until such\ntime as it is possible to hold a con-\nvention in the West, keep up the\nkind of good work you have done\nhere! When the convention is held\nhere, we in the East will undoubte-\ndly have a smaller one of our own!\nMy very best wishes to all you good\npeople in Western Canada, and\nmay you continue to enjoy success\nin collecting!\n\nCN.A.

S. Carroll gave an excellent outline of events at the Regina\nRound-Up in May. He stated that a number of 1936 \u201cdot\u201d coins and\nCanadian 1921 half dollars are being found in Western Canada; appa-\nrently, most of these were sent to the Prairie Provinces'\u2018and British Colum-\nbia when they were issued by the Royal Canadian Mint, so that it is only\n\ni \u2014\n",

At least two evenings will be\ndevoted to special speakers, with new movies to illustrate their subject\nmaterial.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a hectic and amusing auction of Cana-\ndian decimal coins of the period up to 1900, conducted by Major Carroll.\nThe next occasion of our coming together in Ottawa will be on the\nsecond Monday of September.\n\nA.

President Berg thanked Mr. Cardwell on behalf of\nthe Chapter, and announced that a Merit Card will be given to him for\nservices rendered.\n\nMr. R. Naish displayed a photographic enlargement of the 1936\n\u201cdot\u201d quarter, and mentioned that similar prints may be obtained locally.\n\nEvery monthly meeting, fifteen minutes are devoted to our project\nof listing \u201cunlisted\u201d tokens. This time, a vote of thanks was extended\nto Mr. K. Bunnett of Willowdale for his assistance in providing listings\nand excellent rubbings of the Ontario tokens in his possession.

Six new members joined our Chapter\non this occasion.\n\nMr. Galand was congratulated for the excellent coin displays he\nhad prepared and exhibited for a fortnight in two of the main jewellery\nstores of West Vancouver.\n\nA 1936 \u201cdot\u201d dime submitted for examination by one of the new\nmembers was \u2014 after much deliberation and close scrutiny \u2014 pronounced\ngenuine. \u2018This rare and valuable coin is in Fine condition, and appears\nto be the seventh \u201cdot\u201d dime listed.\n\nThe First Annual Banquet of our Chapter will be held at the Devon-\nshire Hotel on June 7, and a large attendance is anticipated. The Press\nis expected to cover our special auction.

    "172": "kindly consented to speak on Canadian medals. In addition, Mr. Fred\nBowman described some interesting items, and Dr. K. Gaver talked briefly\non keeping records and the cataloguing of collections. Mr. W. H.\nRawlings exhibited a trayful of mediaeval coins from many countries,\nwhich provoked much interested comment.\n\nW. H. Rawtiincs,\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe TORONTO COIN CLUB gathering of May 26 was attended\nby 32 members and 6 guests, with Dr. J. S. Wilkinson presiding.\n\nOur speaker, Mr. B. A. Seaby of London, England, reviewed the\nimmensely large field of general numismatics and then answered a wide\nvariety of questions. Mr. Seaby deplored the tendency of North American\nnumismatics to go in for collecting their own date series and rolls of\ncoins, rather than study a broader section of numismatics; he feels that\nthe coinages of Ancient Greece and Rome are neglected here. His example\nof the rarest recent British coin, the 1933 penny, stimulated much dis-\ncussion.\n\nMr. Willey showed an English shilling of 1840, which Mr. Seaby\ndeclared to be a scarce date. \u2018This was purchased in Buffalo, recently,\nfor very little. Mr. C. Kekewich had a U.S. 1916 Denver dime; it rarely\ncomes in such perfect condition.\n\nThe \u201cAdmittance Coin\u201d Draw was won by Dr. Wilkinson. Our\nTable Auctions are proving a great success, with record sales on the\npresent occasion. A Canadian 1947 Maple Leaf half dollar with curved\n\u201c7\u201d, in E. F. condition, was sold during the evening.\n\nFor the summer, our regular meetings will continue in the Royal\nYork Hotel, at 2 P.M. on the fourth Saturday of each month.\n\nPeter S. Favro,\nSecretary.\n\nWINDSOR COIN CLUB'S project of entertaining the Scouts of\nWindsor was a great success in spite of the current transportation strike,\nthough more might have attended if those services had been available.\nOur project was undertaken as a result of executive conferences with local\nScout officials. An exhibition of coins, with talks and explanations,\ntook place at Scout Headquarters on May 23, Displays of numismatic\nmaterial were provided by Messrs. F. O. Hicks, J. J. Dick, George Bull\nand Mrs. Bull, by Mrs. I. R. Austin and Miss Mabel Money. They included\na complete set of C.N.A.

    "187": "Editor\u2019s Page\n\nIn our February issue, an information page was proposed for those\nwho are new to numismatics. In this connection, we now give the data\nwhich follow in the hope that members may profit thereby.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mint officials are understandably reluctant to\ninvestigate or discuss the many small variations that may arise in coin\ndesigns. If a different size or shape is used in the process of striking a\ncertain series, this is of little or no importance to the Mint. All working\ndies are made from a master die, so any difference that exists must occur\nin finishing the die; for instance, the end figure or two of the date are\nusually punched in as new dies are needed, which accounts for the\npredominance of date variations over all others. In 1955, for example, the\nRoyal Canadian Mint used 871 obverse and 773 reverse working dies to\nmint 84,500,000 coins. As the dies are not always changed simultaneously,\nthere is considerable overlapping of the pairs of dies used in striking\ncoins, which means that a collector might have to acquire over a thousand\nexamples of the 1955 issue to be sure of having all possible varieties. The\nofficial Mint report makes no mention of these variations, even when a\nchange is made in the shape of the dime and quarter, like that reported\non page 83 of the April Journal. In the future, as in the past, collectors\nwill continue to find such changes and variations.\n\nThe Mint\u2019s function is primarily to produce coins to facilitate the\ntransaction of the nation\u2019s business at the consumer level; as long as the\ncoins conform to the standards set, minor variations are of no concern.\nConsequently, a slightly different numeral may be used in making one\nof the working dies, as occurred in striking the 1947 ML half dollar with\nthe curved 7, whose rarity is accounted for by the breaking of the die\ntowards the end of the run, when only about 1,000 pieces remained to\nbe struck. Indeed, as long as their technical and mechanical requirements\nare met, Mint officers are not concerned with the numismatic aspect of\ncoin production. Intended differences are, of course, reported. Other\nparticulars listed within the past decade include changes in design, of\nsize, and of devices and legends. Our 1953 quarter was made nearer the\nsize of the U.S. coin to facilitate its use in vending machines of U\u2018S.\nmanufacture; at the same time, the size of the \u201c53\u201d in the date was\ndecreased.\n\n\u2014 17 \u2014-\n",

Exhibits from local collections will show a wide\nvariety of decimal currencies, paper money, medals and badges, as well as\nthe splendid uncirculated and proof coins that Mr. John Griffin has\nrecently acquired. \u2018These include a number of Nova Scotia, New\nBrunswick, and Newfoundland pattern pieces.

The most precious items consist of army warrants used by the\nCommander of the British Forces in Canada to pay debts incurred during\nthe War of 1812-1814, and some examples of French playing card money\ncirculated in this country prior to 1759; these have been made available\nthrough the courtesy of Mr. J.

He\ncommenced the first regular bi-\nmetallic coinage in Europe. Hith-\nerto, gold had only been coined\nspasmodically and then usually at\nsome critical stage of a state\u2019s\nexistence.\n\nMacedon now produced a gold\ncoinage unrivalled by anything\noutside of Asia.\n\nLater tetradrachms had a new\nreverse, a small jockey holding the\n\npalm-branch of victory, riding a\nwalking race-horse, although it looks\nmore like a Percheron. This was\nan allusion to a horse-race won by\nPhilip at Olympia.\n\nThe coinage of Philip had a wide\npopularity, so much so that two-\nthirds of the surviving silver and\ngold coins were minted after his\ndeath, some long after. This does\nnot include the extensive imitations\nof his coins by barbarians, copies of\nwhich were finally being made or\ncirculated in Britain hundreds of\nyears later.\n\nIt has been said that Alexander\nthe Great was not interested in\nmoney. He does seem to have been\nvery concerned about his coinage.\nIn the first place he chose types\n\n.\u2014 161 \u2014\n",
    "192": "that were at least Panhellenic. His\ngold coins bear the head of Athene\nwearing a triple crested Corinthian\nhelmet while the reverse shows the\ngoddess of victory holding a wreath\nand a naval standard. The silver\ncoins show the head of Heracles,\ngreatest of the Greek heroes and, on\nthe reverse, Zeus Olympios enthron-\ned, an eagle on his outstretched\nright hand and a sceptre in his left\nhand. The Phoenician was to see\nin the obverse his own god Melkart,\nthe Cilician was to regard the\nseated deity as the great Ba\u2019al of\nTarsus and the Babylonian to look\non pictures that would recall his\nown Gilgamesh, the lion slayer and\nthe figure of Bel-Marduk, god of\nBabylon.\n\nWhen it is realized that next to\nMacedonia the greatest mints of\nAlexander were to be established\nprecisely in Phoenicia, Cilicia and\nBabylon, the choice of these types\nindicates either remarkable fore-\nsight or amazing coincidence. Al-\nexander also established a mono-\nmetallic standard in the sense that\nhe used the same standard for both\ngold and silver. The growing\nabundance of gold had reduced the\nratio of gold to silver from 13\u00a5%2\nto 1 to 12 to 1 and, when the\nPersian treasures were thrown on\nthe world\u2019s markets, the ratio fell\nto 10 to l.\n\nAlexander is accused of throwing\naway his money recklessly but when\nhe died his wealth was estimated\nat 800,000 talents\u2014at least two\nand a half billion dollars to-day.\nMaybe, like the Australian abori-\ngine with his old boomerang, he\ndied of exhaustion from trying to\nthrow it away.\n\nThere were too many brilliant\nMacedonian generals to set one\nover the other so an epileptic,\nillegitimate son of Philip II and\nthe unborn son of Alexander and\nRoxane were appointed as joint\nkings. The chief generals \u2014 Cas-\nsander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, Ptol-\nemy and Antigonus, whose son\nDemetrius was the greatest admiral\nof the time, all issued coins of\nAlexander\u2019s type, some in the name\nof Philip but most in the name of\nAlexander.\n\nBy 306 B.C., the two nominal\nkings had been murdered and, when\nAntigonus and Demetrius won a\ngreat victory over their rivals, they\nset their names as kings on the\ncoins. The four other generals\nsoon followed suit.\n\nLysimachus of Thrace, issued\ncoins with a magnificent portrait of\nAlexander wearing the royal diadem\nand having the curving ram\u2019s horn\nof Ammon springing from his brow.\nSeltman calls it the finest portrait\nhead on Greek coins. You can\nobserve the Museum specimen to\nsee if you concur.\n\nAt the great battle of Ipsus in\n301 B.C. the four other generals\ndefeated Antigonus who died fight-\ning at the age of eighty-four.\nDemetrius was left with just Cyprus\nas a dominion but he held com-\nmand of all the eastern seas with\nhis fleet. Demetrius now struck\nvery attractive coins with the\ngoddess of victory standing upon a\nprow, holding a naval trumpet to\nher lips. The other side shows\nPoseidon, naked, seen from the\nback, brandishing his trident.\n\n\u2014 162 \u2014\n",

He now\nissued coins bearing his own head,\nthe first certain portrait of a living\nman to appear on a European coin.\n\nDemetrius the Besieger was suc-\nceeded after an interval by his\neldest son, Antigonus the Knock-\nkneed. He inflicted a crushing\ndefeat on the Gauls, it being\nclaimed that the god Pan had\nspread his \u201cpanic\u201d terror among\nthem. His coins commemorate\nthis victory, showing a Macedonian\nshield, with the head of Pan in the\ncentre, with a small goat\u2019s horn\nspringing from his forehead. Ona\nfew of these coins, the head of Pan\nis given the features of Antigonus.\nSeltman points out that horns were\nthe fashion among the early Hel-\nlenistic monarchs; Alexander is\nshown with a ram\u2019s horn, Seleucus\nand Demetrius were portrayed with\nbull\u2019s horns and now Antigonus the\nKnock-kneed with the horn of goat-\nkneed Pan.\n\nThis Antigonus, who died at\neighty, after a reign of about forty\nyears, maintained his father\u2019s tradi-\ntion of minting gold and silver\ncoins in the types of Alexander the\nGreat.\n\nPhilip the Fifth and Perseus\nwere two later Macedonian kings\nwho issued coins of distinctive style.\nFollowing the defeat of Perseus by\nthe Romans, Macedonia was divid-\ned into four regions which were\nallowed to mint their own coins.\nThey chose the head of Artemis in\nthe centre of a Macedonian shield.\n\nAfter the collapse of Macedonia,\nMaroneia and Thasos seem to have\n\ngained control of the silver mines\nbecause, after 148 B.C., they issued\nvery large quantities of big, flat\ntetradrachms. Both coins had a\nrather unattractive Dionysiac head\non one side, Maroneia having\nDionysios on the reverse and\nThasos, Heracles.\n\nSeleucus, who had been one of\nAlexander\u2019s most brilliant cavalry\ncommanders, obtained the satrapy\nof Babylon shortly after the death\nof the latter. Ousted for a time,\nhe regained the metropolis in\n312 B.C., from which year the\nSeleucid era is dated. He extended\nhis empire from the Aegean to the\nIndus. He continued the Alexan-:\nder coinage, although about 312\nB.C. he set his personal seal, an\nanchor, on the coin. This -device\nwas chosen because he had an\nanchor-shaped birth mark on his\nthigh. Later Seleucus issued coins\nfeaturing a horned horse and an\nelephant. The horned horse, ele-\nphant and anchor became hence-\nforward dynastic badges of the\nHouse of Seleucus. This family\nreigned over the fluctuating empire\nof Syria, sometimes immense but\nalways large, until 83 B.C. They\nissued a bewildering variety of coins\nin gold, silver and copper, of which\nthis Museum has a fair representa-\ntion of large silver pieces, several\nof which show very fine portrait\nheads.\n\nIn 83 B.C. the people of Syria\ncalled in Tigranes, the powerful\nking of Armenia to free them from\nthe Seleucids. He did so and\ncoined tetradrachms with his head\nin a tall Armenian tiara ornamented\nwith a rayed sun between two\n\n\u2014 163 \u2014\n",

Lucullus restored the\nlast miserable Seleucid, Antiochus\nXIII, who employed the Zeus type\nfor his degenerate money. Finally,\nin 64 B.C. Pompey the Great took\nover Syria and formed it into a\nRoman province.\n\nAbout 250 B.C., Diodotus, satrap\nof \u201cthe thousand cities of Bactria\u201d\nset up an independent kingdom.\nThis became a flourishing kingdom\nsince it appears that a considerable\nGreek and Macedonian population\nhad been left there by Alexander.\nToynbee would say it was a case of\nchallenge and response but in any\ncase the best of all series of Greek\nportrait coins comes from this\nremote Bactrian kingdom.\n\nOf interest to Canadians, whose\ncountry is the world\u2019s greatest\nproducer of nickel, is the fact that\nthree Bactrian monarchs issued\ncoins with a nickel content amaz-\ningly similar to that in the US.\nBuffalo Nickel. Nickel as an\nelement was not recognized and\nisolated until A.D. 1751, as com-\nmemorated on our Canadian Nick-\nels in 1951. The name comes from\nKupfernickel or Demon - Copper\napplied by medieval European\nminers to an ore that they mistook\nfor copper but which, because of\nits nickel content and consequent\nhigh melting point, was beyond\ntheir metallurgical techniques. The\nBactrians, who may have employed\nChinese craftsmen, solved the prob-\nlem by producing the intense heat\nnecessary. After the fall of Bactria,\nthe element Nickel vanished from\ncoinage until A.D. 1850.\n\nOne of the most interesting\ncharacters to obtain a kingdom\nafter the death of Alexander was\nthe eunuch Philetaerus, Lord of\nPergamum. He was severely injur-\ned as a child but rose through\nsheer ability to become a ranking\nofficer in the army of Antigonus.\nWhen the latter was killed, he\nbecame a lieutenant of Lysimachus\nand later was placed in charge of\nthe treasury of nine thousand\ntalents stored at Pergamum. In\ngood old civil service style, Phile-\ntaerus made himself very agreeable\nto the son and heir of Lysimachus.\nHowever, Lysimachus took a new\n\n\u2018wife, Arsinoe, the beautiful daugh-\n\nter of Ptolemy, and she saw little\npoint in producing a son unless he\nwas going to be the heir. When\nshe had the heir apparent murder-\ned, Philataerus felt himself in a\ndangerous position. He pledged\nthe treasure to Seleucus if he would\nhelp him out of this difficulty.\nSeleucus invaded Asia Minor and\ndefeated Lysimachus, who died in\nbattle. Within seven months,\nSeleucus was assassinated and his\nempire thrown into a chaotic state.\nPhiletaerus ransomed the body of\nSeleucus for his son Antiochus and\nmade judicial outlays to strengthen\nneighbouring cities against the\nGauls and ended up with clear title\nto Pergamum and the treasure.\n\nIf you could say that a eunuch\ncould found a dynasty, Philetaerus\ndid so because his nephew succeed-\ned him and the family reigned in\nPergamum from 280 to 133 B.C.,\nwhen the last of the family willed\nthe country to Rome. Philetaerus\nissued coins with the head of his\nsuzerain of the moment. After his\n\n\u2014 164 \u2014\n",

Despite the\ntruly Greek delicacy of plane and\ncontour, the features display the\nbrutal frankness of Roman portrai-\nture. \u2018The eye is small and possibly\ncrafty but has a direct, intense gaze.\nThe fatness of cheek and jowl do\nnot hide the firm and powerful jaw\nbeneath. \u2018The reason for describ-\ning this coin so fully is that the\nMuseum\u2019s specimen is mounted\nface down, showing you the other\nside with a seated figure of Athene.\n\nPtolemy was awarded the satrapy\nof Egypt at the death of Alexander,\nbut when he attempted to annex\nCyrenaica, Perdiccas as regent of\nthe empire set out with the whole\nroyal army to depose him. This\narmy, which had conquered half of\nAsia was defeated, Perdiccas assas-\nsinated and the regency offered to\nPtolemy who merely had himself\nconfirmed in possession of Egypt\nand Cyrene. He was the first satrap\nto change the coin types, placing\nAlexander\u2019s head in an elephant\nskin headdress. In time, Ptolemy\ntook over Cyprus, Palestine and\nPhoenicia. He now adopted the\nPhoenician weight system and issu-\ned fine coins in all metals. On the\ngold and silver coins there is a fine,\nrealistic head of Ptolemy while the\nreverse of the silver carries a\nsplendid eagle, facing left and\ngrasping a thunderbolt. This is the\nstandard design for the coins of his\nsuccessors, although there were\nsome exceptions.\n\nHis son, Ptolemy II, married his\nsister Arsinoe who had been widow-\ned by the death of Lysimachus.\nHis nickname, Philadephus, thus\n\nreally meant another kind of broth-\nerly love than that ordinarily asso-\nciated with the city in the United\nStates. When Arsinoe died in 270\nB.C. she was deified and given a\nplace in the cultus of existing\ntemples, a stroke of policy that\nplaced in the royal treasury large\nfunds from temples that were\nforced to adopt her cult. Peron\nnever got quite that far with Evita.\n\nThe Egyptians valued copper at\nan unusually high rate, something\napproaching 30 of silver to 1 of\ncopper. Sums stated in copper are\nalways multiples of five, from which\nit is inferred that the smallest\ndenomination was the five drachm\npiece. This is the coin that set in\nmotion the automatic machines\nthat supplied the devout with\nlustral water at the doors of certain\ntemples in Alexandria. This coin\nmachine is attributed to Hero who\nlived in the first century B.C., and\nhe is also credited with demonstrat-\ning jet propulsion in the harbour\nof the same city.\n\nPyrrhus, King of Epirus and, for\nshort periods, King of Macedon and\nSicily, was responsible for the term\nPyrthic victory. He was supposed\nto have a ring of solid bone in each\njaw instead of teeth. Pyrrhus\nmarried a daughter of Arsinoe and\nPtolemy and used the latter\u2019s design\nof an archaized fighting Athene\n\n\u2018on the reverse of some of his coins.\n\nThe favourite coin of my own little\ncollection is one of these issued in\nSyracuse and bearing a head of\nKore.\n\nGreek coinage as an art form\ndeserves more attention than can\nbe given here.

Greek\ncoinage can show us many an\nindifferent coin, crudely conceived\nand executed in the early days,\nfacile and academic in the later,\nand often undistinguished at all\ntimes. Considered as a whole, its\ngeneral standard of perfection,\nthrough the combination of power\nand instinctively sought beauty,\ncauses it to stand out from among\nthe artistry of any monetary series\nof comparable length.\u201d Dr. Wal-\nlace believes that only the Greek\ndie-engravers fully recognized the\nlimitations of the small scale in\nwhich they worked and that the\nresultant simplicity and boldness\nof most of their designs is respon-\nsible for their superiority.\n\nFrom the standpoint of collect-\ning, most Greek gold coins and the\nfinest and rarest in silver are very\ncostly. Many fine silver and copper\ncoins are not too expensive. You\ndon\u2019t have to be wealthy to collect\nGreek coins, but it helps.\n\nThe Museum has a display of\ncoins connected with biblical his-\ntory. The Jewish coins are interest-\ning because of their background\nbut, with the exception of a few\nsilver ones, are very commonplace\nin design. \u2018The coins of Tyre,\nSidon, Aradus, \u2018Tarsus and Carthage\nhave better designs, usually show-\ning strong Greek influences. The\nPhoenicians at an early stage\n\nadopted written promises of pay-\nment, usually on sheepskin, to avoid\nloss of precious metals in shipment.\n\nThe Parthians who ruled in\nPersia from 249 B.C. to A.D. 226\nissued many fine coins, especially\nin the first half of that period.\nMr. Fred Armstrong has specialized\nin the collection of this series. The\nNeo-Persian Empire of the Sas-\nsanians, from A.D. 226-651 issued\nan interesting, if rather monotonous\ncoinage.\n\nThe parts of central Italy that\nwere not under direct Greek\ninfluence used bronze as a medium\nof exchange. This evolved to a\nstage when bronze was cast in\ncircular forms \u2014 aes grave \u2014 having\ndistinctive symbols and marks of\nvalue. These pieces were reckoned\non a duodecimal system, the unit\nof reckoning being the pound. The\nextension of Roman power through-\nout Italy reached a point where it\nwas necessary for Rome to inaugu-\nrate a coinage under her own name\nand authority. This earliest Roman\ncoinage began in 269 B.C. It\ncomprised didrachms and small\nbronze coins modelled on Italo-\nGreek coinage, in addition to aes\ngrave whose circulation may have\nbeen confined to Central Italy.\nThe difficulty of adjusting the\nvalue of bronze to silver produced\na series of reductions in the size of\nthe bronze denominations. \u2018The\nsilver coinage began, under the\nundoubted influence of Greek\ndesigners, with conventionally ele-\ngant style. This fairly soon\ndeteriorated to harsh and relatively\nstereotyped designs, possibly be-\ncause the mass production now\n\n\u2014 166 \u2014\n",

The sacking\nof Corinth was followed by a\nmovement of Greek teachers and\ntechnicians to Rome, which now\noffered them greater opportunities\nthan remained at home. At all\nevents, there was a general improve-\nment in the quality of coin-design\nand some of them were excellent.\n\nSydenham lists some fourteen\nhundred coins of Republican Rome\nand this is by no means complete.\nFrom the collecting standpoint,\nthis series is very attractive because\nmany of the coins are inexpensive\neven when they are in an extremely\nfine state of preservation.\n\nAugustus re-organized the coinage\nwhich henceforth was designed to\nserve imperial propaganda.

The rest was curled and\ndrawn to the top of her head, being\nheld in place by a large coiled\nbraid.\n\nSince Greek times, the lettering\non a coin was often placed on a\nseparate punch, which avoided\nchanging an entire die when alter-\nations were being made. \u2018The\namazing feature of this is that it\nwas an actual form of printing and\nyet no practical adaptation to print\npamphlets or books was made in\nthe Western world for almost\n2,000 years.\n\nThe Roman provincial coinage\nof Egypt is unusual because Egypt\nwas the property of the Emperor\nhimself, who received the vast\nrevenues of the country. The\nPtolemaic system of state control\nwas maintained and the Roman\nemperors were described as a new\ndynasty of Pharaohs.\n\nThe Egyptian coinage was a\nwholly token currency. It consist-\ned of base-silver tetradrachms\n(worth only one denarius apiece\nas against four for most tetra-\ndrachms of the period) and a series\nof bronze denominations.

This\nhas since been examined by several experts, and the concensus of opinion\n\nis that the mark is entirely adventitious.\n\nThe Associated Press reports the finding of a large hoard of ancient\ncoins at Gela in Sicily, recently. Workmen excavating a cellar came upon\na large vase containing about nine hundred coins, said to date from the\n5th Century B.C., which they proceeded to sell upon the black market.\nProfessor Dinu Adamasteanu, an authority on Sicilian archaeology, called\nthe treasure \u201cone of the richest ever found \u2014 worth hundreds of thousands\nof dollars\u201d. Other archaeologists agree that the find may prove to be the\nmost valuable of all hoards of early Greek coins so far unearthed. Since\nItalian law declares all archaeological finds to be state property, this\ntreasure will be turned over to local museums. Police believe that they\n\nhave recovered most of the hoard.\n\nReports from C.N.A.

Wilson Collection\n\nby Fred Bowman, F.R.N.S.\n\nThe Wilson collection was, without doubt, the largest accumulation\nof rare Canadian coins ever to be brought together in a single collection.\n\nMr. Wilson was born in 1869, the son of Mr. J. C. Wilson, who\nfounded the J. C. Wilson Paper Mills Co. Limited. In his later years,\nhe was a partner in his father\u2019s business. He lived for many years at\nBeauharnois but some years before his death he moved to No. 111\nCrescent Street in Montreal, where he died on March 16, 1924 at the\nage of fifty-five years.\n\nHe was a member of the American Numismatic Association and held\nthe office of first vice-president in 1909 and 1910. In 1910 he purchased\nthe \u201cNumismatist\u201d from Mr. Farran Zerbe and presented it as a gift to\nthe Association. In recognition of this gesture he was elected an honorary\nlife member on August 28, 1912.\n\nWhile his collection contained many gold and other rare coins of\nmany countries, especially of the United States, his primary interest\nalways remained with the Canadian series. His collection also contained\nmany rare Canadian and other medals but it is his collection of rare\nCanadian coins which we will here briefly describe.\n\nHe personally attended many coins sales both in the United States\nand in England and brought to Canada many rare patterns previously\nunknown on this side of the Atlantic. He purchased a number of\ncomplete collections including the very fine Thomas Wilson collection\nwhich was exceptionally strong in Bouquet Sous.\n\nAfter his death the collection was catalogued by Wayte Raymond\nin New York and sold at auction in four separate sales in 1925, 1926,\n1927 and 1928.\n\nThe collection contained:\n\n4 pieces card money\n2 \u2014 1670 fifteen sol pieces\n8 \u2014 1670 five sol pieces\n107 \u2014 French Canadian Jetons in silver and copper\n1 \u2014 Papineau halfpenny, mule of two reverses in silver -\n1 \u2014 Papineau halfpenny 1844, silver proof\n22 \u2014 Side view pennies\n25 \u2014 Side view halfpennies\n6\u2014 Bank of Montreal front view pennies dated 1837 in copper and\none in nickel\n2 \u2014 Bank of Montreal front view halfpennies dated 1845\n62 \u2014 Bout de I\u2019Isle bridge tokens, original type\n\n\u2014 178 \u2014\n",

S. Witxinson\n\nA lecture on \u201cCoin Collecting\u201d delivered in a museum appreciation course\nat the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, 28th of November, 1955\n\n(Continued from August issue)\n\nByzantium stood fast when the Western Roman empire collapsed\nin the fifth century A.D. During the next century, Byzantium had\nreconquered much of that empire. The spiritual importance of this\ncolossal achievement was immense because Byzantium was propagating a\nChristian tradition far more elaborate than any which Rome had\npropounded. Justinian\u2019s policy had established that church and state,\nalthough formally distinct, were one and the same in practice. Religion,\ntherefore, became the almost exclusive theme of Byzantine art and, as\ncoinage in the classical tradition was regarded as a form of socially applied\nart, impregnated the coins.\n\nIn the Roman coinage, Christian elements had increased in the\ncentury and a half after Constantine the Great. There was little change\nin the Byzantine coins until the accession of Justinian, A.D. 527, but\nfrom this time on an increasingly hieratic style is shown. Profile heads\nare replaced by facing heads with haloes, their hands holding crosses, orbs\nand sceptres which marked the rulers as near-Popes. The Roman figure\nof winged Victory had become transformed into a Christian angel\nholding a cross.\n\nAt the time of Heraclius, 610-641, when the kingdom consisted of\nlittle more than the Balkans and Asia Minor, the coinage reached the\npeak of its characteristic beauty. By the middle of his reign, the coin-\ndesigners were working in what could be called the early medieval style\n\n\u2014 180 \u2014\n",
    "215": "of Byzantium. The portraiture became more realistic and the technical\nexecution of the coins is much improved.\n\nWhen Justinian II introduced the head of Christ on coins soon after\n685, it was often represented in a naturalistic style that contrasted with\nthe formal royal portrait on the same coin.\n\nFor us, it is a strange feature that the Byzantine coins, while so\nreligious, have dominus noster \u2014 our Lord \u2014 as the title of the king.\n\nThe technique of Byzantine coin-designers was, in general, inferior\nto those of Greece and Rome, their only ascendancy being achieved in the\nfield of design. They sometimes show originality of conception but their\nartistic interest is confined to the decorative sense. \u2018They allowed their\nobviously fine powers of delicate and decorative engraving to degenerate\nduring the last four centuries of Byzantine independence. Yet it was on\nthis residual capacity for fine engraving and decorative form that the\nearly Renaissance artists were soon to draw so fully.\n\nIn Germany in the twelfth century, a peculiar type of coin was\ndeveloped, called bracteate by us but denarius or pfennig by them.\nThese were almost paper-thin disks of metal \u2018which bore a_ perfect\nimpression on one side only, the other side showing no more than a ghost\nof this impression. Such coins were very fragile but they provided the\ncoin-designer with a relatively large field for a design which he could\npresent in high relief. . This was a school of art that could only be called\n\u201cprimitive\u201d; its technique was rough and its treatment of the human\nfigure was often perfunctory. Yet the achievement of the bracteate\nartists is amazing \u2014 for the first time in Western Europe they picture\nthe background of Christian tradition and chivalry with a simple pathos.\nThe designs would appear to have some base in Byzantine art, whose\ncoins the designers may have seen. However, they broke abruptly from\nthe current traditions, showing a true feeling for depth and expression.\nUnfortunately, our Museum does not have any specimens of this\ninteresting coinage.\n\nWith the exception of the bracteate artists of Germany, no advances\nin the technical methods of coining had been made from those developed\nby the early Greeks. It was in the fifteenth century that a revolutionary\nchange was made by Antonio Pisano of Verona, surnamed Pisanello.\nInstead of engraving metal dies, he modelled his designs in relief in wax\nand then made moulds from which medals were cast. It was the artistic\ngenius of Pisanello that produced his matchless medals but the ingenious\nmode of production made them more attractive than would have been\npossible by earlier methods.\n\nThere were many beautiful medals produced after the style of\nPisanello although it is debated whether anyone has 'ever equalled his\nsimple perfection, shrewd realism and easy dignity. Medals will not be\n\n\u2014 181 \u2014\n",
    "216": "dealt with at length here because the few non-military medals in the\nMuseum\u2019s collection are, for the most part, not on display. The Museum\nhas some fine and interesting military medals but the collection is easily\nsurpassed by that of the Military Institute, on University Avenue.\n\nThe importance to us, of the medals of Pisanello and his followers,\nis the stimulus they gave to coin-designers. Coins had been cast, even in\nancient times, but satisfactory results had never been produced under\nconditions of mass production. Now Caradossa of Milan with Benvenuto\nCellini paid\u2019 particular attention to the substitution of mechanical for\nmanual methods of striking. The most notable work of Caradossa was\nthe coinage of the Sforza family at Milan. The dies are unsigned and\nsome are attributed to Leonardo de Vinci, who was in Milan at that time,\nbut in any case the results are superb. Francesco Francis of Bologna,\nrenowned both as a painter and a die cutter, produced dies of distinction\nalthough not equal to the foregoing.\n\nThe strength of Renaissance ideas in coin design spread widely. The\nnew coining machinery enabled much larger quantities of much larger\ncoins to be stamped from dies of steadily increasing elaboration. All over\nEurope coins became more and more medallic in character. As with\nmost forms of progress, it was not uninterrupted. In England the vested\ninterests of the guild of moneyers resulted in the new machinery being\nthrown out because it required few workers. It was some forty years -\nlater before machinery was re-introduced.\n\nThe coinage of the British Isles is of great interest to most of us\nbecause of its connection with the history we have been taught. The\ndisplay of British coins in this Museum, arranged by Mr. Fred Armstrong,\nshows historical continuity without presenting overpowering numbers.\nThere is a judicious sprinkling of gold and copper coins to give some\nvariation from the silver which provided the backbone of the coinage\nuntil the seventeenth century.\n\nIt might be of interest to outline the history of the guinea in relation\nto the pound sterling. The name is derived from the British custom of\nplacing symbols on gold and silver coins to show the origin of the metal.\nWhen made with silver from Wales, the coins show the Welsh plumes;\nwhen silver was seized from the Spanish ships captured at Vigo Bay, the\ncoins from it were marked with \u201cVigo\u201d. Gold and silver brought by the\nAfrica Company were made into coins marked by an elephant, changed in\n1675 to the elephant and castle.\n\nIn the reign of William and Mary, silver was coined at 5s.2d. an\nounce while it was worth 5s.3-1/2d. for export. Enormous quantities of\ncoin were shipped to France and Holland and the silver currency that\nremained was almost entirely clipped and light coin. The value of the\ngold coin rose until the guinea reached 30s. in 1694. The government\ndecided upon a great recoinage scheme and the value of the guinea was\nreduced to 21s.6d. by statute in 1698.\n\n\u2014 182 \u2014\n",
    "217": "The exportation of silver was not stopped as long as its face value\nwas below the market value. Sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint,\nreported on the gold and silver coinage and estimated the value of the\nguinea to be 20s.8d. and it was not raised to 21s. It was shown that in\nthat year nearly \u00a33,000,000 of silver was exported by the East India\nCompany alone.\n\nVarious expedients were tried until, in 1816, the coinage was put on a\n. gold standard and the silver and copper coins became subsidiary money\nwithout equivalent intrinsic value.\n\nThis Museum has no exhibit of European coins and it would be\nimpossible to present any reasonable outline of the various coinage in a\nshort time. The best known of all coins of the European continent is\nthe thaler which enjoyed an uninterrupted popularity for four centuries.\n\nIn 1484 the Archduke of Tyrol issued the so-called Guldengroschen,\napproximately the size of a thaler. These large silver coins were in great\ndemand and were copied at other mints. In 1525, those issued in\nJoachimsthal in Bohemia were called Joachimsthaler which was soon\nshortened to Thaler. These coins were adopted sooner or later by most\nEuropean countries with some variations in the name, e.g. \u2014 Daler,\n. Tallero, etc.\n\nSpanish silver coins of 8 reales issued by the millions from the Spanish\npossessions in America became widely known as pieces of eight. \u2018These\ncirculated far afield from the Spanish countries and were used in the\nUnited States and Canada until there were adequate official silver coins\nin the respective countries. \u2018The later forms were called Spanish milled\ndollars and they were used in China until very recent days, where the\ncoins were minted as exact copies down to the Mo mint mark of Mexico\nCity. For most of the hundreds of years they were issued, they bore the .\npillars of Hercules and the scroll of Cadiz which provides the origin of\nour sign for the dollar.\n\nIn the British West Indies and elsewhere, fractions of the pieces of\neight were obtained by punching a piece out of the centre of the coin or\nsimply by dividing the coin into sections. These fractions were expressed\nin terms of reales but were called bitts, thus one-quarter of an eight reales\npiece was called two bitts. \u2018The medio real or half real of the Spanish\ncurrency was called the picayune and this word has entered our language\nas a synonym for small or petty. Also, it is the background for the name\nof the New Orleans newspaper, \u2018Times-Picayune.\n\nWhen the half-dime was introduced into use, it was popularly called\na picayune in the Southern States because they were of approximately\nthe same size and value, and it was the price for a copy of the paper.\n\n\u2014 183 \u2014\n",

Prior to this, no artifacts of Chinese origin\nare definitely known, even though the odd inscription or coin may be\nhopefully attributed to the supposed First Dynasty of China, called the\nHsia. Recently, for instance, I was given the opportunity of bidding on\na collection of some 2,500 Chinese copper coins put up for auction by\none of the most reputable dealers in Britain.

In\narchaeology, this kind of carelessness in making attributions could cause\na scholar to \u201close face\u201d, as the Chinese say. Among numismatists, it is\none of the chief reasons why coin dealers and collectors are not taken\nvery seriously by archaeologists and historians. Yet numismatics in its\ntrue meaning \u2014 as I mentioned in an earlier paper \u2014 is one of our main\nsources of accurate information on human origins and progress over the\npast three thousand years. I hope that you will bear with me in this\nlong digression on the importance of correct statements about our coins.\n\n\u2014 184 \u2014\n",
    "219": "Without accuracy, our fascinating and really valuable avocation may\neasily be degraded to the status of mere money-grubbing for profit, or\ncomes to be considered (as it generally is today) a slightly childish hobby\nwhich has little of consequence to offer. It seems especially appropriate\nto say all this regarding the oldest Chinese currencies because the\narchaeology of China is highly complicated, \u2014 and in no small measure\nthis is due to the very small amount of scientific excavation that has been\npossible in that great and troubled land. We have a minimum of data\non their hoards of old coins because, as a rule, these have been dug up\nby poor peasants who then sold them to curio dealers, often as one\nmeans of saving themselves from starvation.\n\nChinese copper coins are important inasmuch as they constitute the\nprincipal form of money used in the Far East \u2014 including Japan, Korea,\nand Annam or Indo-China \u2014 from at least the 7th Century B.C. down\nto the present century. Prior to 700 B.C., and possibly as early as\n1400 B.C., other convenient small media of exchange were favoured \u2014\nnotably cowrie shells. Before 1000 B.C., these beautiful little shells\nseem to have been quite scarce among the ancestral Chinese people, who\nlived in what is now north central China, far from the source of supply.\nThey held one string of ten cowries to be worth slaves and domestic\nanimals, so that several strings of them were esteemed a princely gift,\nwhile larger quantities could be literally worth a king\u2019s ransom. Of course,\nas time passed and channels of communication with the sea improved,\nby land and by water, cowrie shells gradually became more common, but\neven as late as 425 B.C.\u2014the approximate date of my oldest Chinese\ncopper coin \u2014 we find on it the inscription, in large seal characters: one\ncowrie string. This medium-sized, hollow-handled spade coin, eight\ncentimetres in overall length, \u2014 was a piece of fair value shortly after the\ntime of Confucius. Accordingly, by the late 5th Century B.C., and after\nthe passage of six hundred years, ten cowries could no longer command\nslaves and animals, but were still worth this bronze spade coin.\n\nThe beginning of the use of spades and knives as money in China is\nnot far to seek: the great mass of Chinese have won their living from\nthe soil back to the dawn of history; consequently, farmer\u2019s tool such as\nspades, hoes and pruning knives could also become convenient and\npractical units of exchange for goods and services, as they probably did\nfrom the time of their first production early in the Chou Dynasty. At any\nrate, bronze was sufficiently common to permit of its use in making\nagricultural implements by the 7th Century B.C. The first spade \u201ccoins\u201d\nwere the spades and hoes themselves. When one bronze spade of given\nsize, weight and quality gained acceptance as money, its very bulk forced\npeople to consider whether smaller units of the same shape and relative\ncopper content might not suffice for fractional values. During the later\nChou Dynasty, from the 5th to the 3rd Centuries B.C., the spades\nthemselves evidently ceased to be units of exchange, since smaller\n\n\u2014 185 \u2014\n",
    "220": "replicas of them could be employed; in flattened, modified form, with\nholes in the top for stringing, these last were much more easy to handle.\nThe same applies to bronze knives adapted for use as money. The latest\nspade and knife coins \u2014 those just prior to 250 B.C., and finally of Wang\nMang\u2019s brief revival, from A.D. 7 to 22 \u2014are not easily recognized for\nthe farm tools from which they were originally derived. \u2018This is especially\ntrue of the spades, with their flat flans, raised edges all around, deep,\nwedge-shaped cut at the bottom, and holed neck. Indeed, these late\nforms of spade currency so much resemble: Chinese trousers that they are\nsometimes called \u201ctrouser\u201d money. A feature of importance is that from\nat least the 5th Century B.C. onwards, the various forms of copper money\nwere normally inscribed with some indication of their value in seal\ncharacters and often, too, they bear the name of their mint town.\n\nReturning briefly to cowries, we find that replicas of cowries were\nmade of bone or bronze for use as grave money back about 1100 B.C., in\nShang or early Chou times. By the 3rd Century B.C., in what is now\neast central China (then called the State of Ch\u2019u), flat-bottomed copper\ncowries came into general circulation as a kind of small change.\nAntiquaries until recent times dubbed this \u201c\u2018ant-nose money\u201d from its\nsupposed resemblance to a big ant\u2019s head, going so far as to imagine that\nwhat is really a mark of value or weight was intended to represent the huge\nantennae and great triangular eyes of an ant-ghost, the coin being designed\nto frighten ants away from tombs. We must admire the ingenuity that\ntook the trouble to work all this out, \u2014 if it were only true! Carrying our\nthoughts a bit further along these lines: Italians call cowries porcellani or\npiglets from their fancied resemblance to plump little china pigs. Now,\nfine chinaware has a similar surface texture to cowries, and here we find\nthe origin of our word \u201cporcelain\u201d: in other words, the best china (named\nafter the country where it was first produced in large quantities) had the\ncharacteristic look and feeling of cowrie shells \u2014 which were, perhaps, the\nprimitive form of Chinese currency \u2014 to such an extent that Europeans\nnamed it \u201cporcelain\u201d from the Italian word for cowrie.\n\nAnother important medium of exchange in China 2000 years ago\nwas silk, which the Ancient Roman bought at high prices through Persia\nand India. Until the 6th Century A.D., Europeans supposed that the\nChinese combed it from trees, or so they were told by the middlemen.\nHowever, about A.D. 532 monks returning to Constantinople from the\nOrient managed to smuggle back mulberry leaves containing silkworm\neggs and cocoons in the hollow pilgrim staffs they carried with them.\nAfter that, the West ceased to be solely dependent upon the Chinese\nsource for silk. China had long used the roll of silk as a unit of currency,\neach roll consisting of finely woven brocade one (Chinese) foot wide and\nforty feet long. Great numbers of silk rolls helped to buy off the nomadic\nhords pressing in upon north China around the time of Christ. Bits and\npieces of these very brocades have actually survived in nomad burials\n\n\u2014 186 \u2014\n",
    "221": "through twenty centuries and more, down to our own day, preserved by\nthe dryness of Central Asian deserts!\n\nIn A.D. 105, rag paper was invented in China; some 500 years after-\nwards it appears that printing began to come into general use: printing\nfrom wood blocks, however, since this proved less expensive with the\nChinese characters and cheap labour than the use of movable type.\nFacsimile reproductions exist of Chinese paper money dating back to the\n9th Century A.D., though what may be the oldest surviving specimen\nwas printed in 1154. I own two examples of early Ming paper money\nissued in 1368, eighty years before the first printing in Europe. These\n600-year-old paper notes consist of large rectangular pieces of coarse grey\npulp made from the bark of the paper mulberry, on which the design was\nstamped in what we call \u201cIndia\u201d ink; over this in scarlet was applied the\nimperial seal, to give the money official sanction. The characters on the\nbill warn that it must be accepted at a face value of 1,000 cash, while\ncounterfeiters would lose their heads, but one should add that such\nthreats generally proved ineffectual, since governments of the period put\nforth enormous quantities of paper currency for a long time before they\nrealized that this was not an easy way of creating wealth. Columbia\nUniversity in New York possesses a bronze block used for printing money\nabout the year 1287 under the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan, at the time\nMarco Polo the Venetian was visiting China.\n\nThe early forms of money we have just considered illustrate, directly\nor indirectly, three of China\u2019s greatest contributions to human progress\nand world civilization: first, porcelain \u2014 which is inexpensive, and keeps\nour food clean, thus preventing men and their children from suffering too\nmuch bacterial infection or being poisoned; secondly, paper in all of its\nprincipal forms \u2014 from the finest tissue to material as thick and strong\nas leather \u2014 was in common use among the Chinese at least 1200 years\nago, and provided them with a cheap but ideal medium on which to indite\nletters, or for the preservation of knowledge and communication of ideas,\njust as it does for all of us today; thirdly, we have received from China \u2014\nthough indirectly \u2014 her invention of printing, which not only makes it\npossible for us to use paper money instead of metal, but also permits or\nshould permit all men to learn from the printed page and to achieve\neducation according to their needs and abilities. I think you will agree\nthat it is impossible to overestimate the importance of these three\ninventions which I have merely touched upon in their relationship to\ncertain Chinese currencies.\n\n(To be continued)\n\n\u2014 187 \u2014\n",

The second appeared in 1954 on the occasion of the\nCentennial Festival of Kitchener, Ontario, called \u201cThe City of Talent\u2019.\nThe third came in 1955 with the Centenary celebrations of Whitby,\nOntario, known as \u201cThe County Town\u201d. The fourth commemorated\nthe 1955 Centennial of London, Ontario, \u201cThe Forest City\u201d. A fifth\nalso appeared in 1955 in honour of the first hundred years of the \u201cSoo\u201d\nLocks, at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nSince the Kitchener wooden nickels enjoyed much success, several\nspeculative, money-making, or advertising issues appeared that were\nunconnected with anniversary celebrations. Those of the kind that have\ncome to our attention are: Gananoque, 1954, with a variant form;\nNiagara Falls\u2019 Maid of the Mist, 1955; Canada Coin Exchange, 1955;\nand Lindsay, 1956, in both printed and embossed varieties.\n\nGenerally speaking, little imagination or originality of design has\nbeen shown in either the commemorative or the commercial types. The\nsize and obverse of the Kitchener \u201ccoin\u201d set the model for more recent\nissues except for that of the \u201cSoo\u201d Locks, which achieves a design and\nsize of its own, including the seven-and-a-half cent \u201cdickel\u201d (half way\nbetween a dime and a nickel). These are in several colours. The wooden\nnickel put out by the Canada Coin Exchange has its own distinctive\nstyle; it is similar in size to the \u201cSoo\u201d issue, but thicker.\n\nNumerous medals and metal or plastic tokens have appeared as\nsouvenirs of anniversaries during recent years. Among them are the\nNiagara Falls Golden Anniversary, 1954, in bronze; the Windsor Centen-\nnial, a large aluminum medal, in 1954; Edmonton\u2019s 50th Anniversary,\n1954 (plastic); Alberta\u2019s Golden Jubilee, 1955 (copper); Centenary of\nConsecration of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist at St. John\u2019s,\nNewfoundland, in 1955 (aluminum); and the 1956 Centennial of Paris,\nOntario (plastic). Peterborough issued a stamp-like sticker for its Centen-\nnial in 1950.\n\nAll of these items may be considered to possess numismatic interest,\nand doubtless will be much sought after in times to come. The Prescott\n\u201cnickel\u201d is already very scarce.\n\n\u2014 197 \u2014\n",

Because of the unavoidable absence of\nMr. J. D.

A. Dennis of London brought the City\u2019s greetings, and\nreferred to the early money of London, with transactions conducted in\npounds, shillings, and pence a century ago when London became a city.\nCentennial wooden nickels were given to each guest at the banquet as\na gift from the Mayor; in referring to these His Worship promised that\nthe City Treasurer would redeem them for full value provided anyone\npresent would bring them back to London on the occasion of the City\u2019s\nnext Centennial.\n\nMr. G. R. L. Potter of Ottawa, President of the Association, who\nchaired the Convention\u2019s business sessions, spoke of the growth of the\nC.N.A. since its inception. He thanked the London Coin Club for\nholding the Convention, which attracted the largest attendance of any\nof the Association\u2019s annual meetings up to the present time.\n\nMr. Vincent Greene of Toronto, C.N.A. Vice-President, said how\nmuch he had enjoyed the London Convention, which had brought so\nmany American members of the C.N.A. together with Canadian\nmembers.\n\nMr. R. S. Yeoman of Milwaukee, Wisconsin spoke on behalf of the\nmany American C.N.A. members present. He paid tribute to the excel-\nlence of the coinage produced since 1908 by \u2018The Royal Canadian Mint\nat Ottawa.

    "238": "Canadian Decorations\nand Medals\n\nAn Address given by Mr. J. D. Ferguson, F.R.N.S.,\nto Ottawa Chapter +1, on May 14, 1956.\n\nI was delighted to read in the Canadian Numismatic Journal that\nyou had had the privilege of hearing a lecture by Major Carroll on\nCanadian paper money. It is my intention this evening to cover in a\ngeneral way another important branch of Canadian numismatics :\ndecorations and medals.\n\nAddison, writing many years ago in England, said: \u201cMedals give\na great light to history in confirming such passages as are true, and old\nauthors in settling such as are told in different manners, and recording\nsuch as have been omitted. In this case, a cabinet of medals is a body\nof history.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cmedal\u201d, as used by early numismatists, had a more general\nmeaning, for it included coins. Rome is noted for its early medallions.\nItalian medals followed the Roman tradition ten centuries later, and\ngave us some of the finest examples of Renaissance art. This medallic\nart spread from Italy to France and Germany, Holland and England.\n\nThe earliest medals pertaining to Canada were pieces struck in\nFrance and Britain. Of the more recent examples, many continued to\nbe engraved and struck in those countries, although medals have been\nproduced in Canada since at least 1840. Individual medals were prepared\nby Canadian silversmiths in this country at an even earlier period.\n\nWhen we examine the principal numismatic collections formed in\nEurope, \u2014 and fortunately many of them were fully described in illustrated\nbooks \u2014 those who are interested may be surprised to learn that the\nmedal was given the place of honour. The reason was that the medal,\nbecause of its larger flan, allowed the great artists often employed for\nthis work more scope for beautiful design than was possible on most\ncoins. Invariably a medal commemorated some notable event or per-\nsonage, and was issued in limited quantity. \u2018This practice of giving a\ngreat deal of attention to the medals in a numismatic collection was\nfollowed by nearly all prominent numismatists in the past, and has\ncontinued with many of those in our own era.\n\nA broader understanding of the full scope of numismatics is, I\nbelieve, most pertinent today in view of the large increase in numbers\nof Canadian collectors who, for the most part, have commenced their\ncollecting \u2014 and in many instances have developed remarkable collec-\n\n\u2014 200 \u2014\n",
    "239": "tions \u2014 with the Canadian dated series of coinage. Quite a few of\nthese men are now faced with the decision as to what branch of Can-\nadian numismatics they should follow next, since they are limited other-\nwise in their collecting to slightly improving the condition of a coin,\nor to locating a specimen with a retouched die or some other minute\nvariation which has limited interest to others and even to themselves.\n\nThe obvious step that most have taken, very often along with the\nformation of their dated series, is the collecting of Canadian tokens.\nThis is a fascinating series, and with the aid of monographs and articles\npublished by Dr. Courteau, Mr. McLachlan, Judge Lees and Howland\nWood, the tokens offer a broad and rewarding range of interest.\n\nAfter forty years of serious collecting, I have come to feel that the\nassembling and study of Canadian medals and paper money is much\nmore enjoyable than the other two phases of Canadian numismatics\nand that such collections, when formed, are of much greater interest\nto the public in general, to fellow-numismatists, and to friends. When\nyow show your collection of dated coins, you win admiration from your\nfellow-collector if the examples are in choice condition or include rarities,\nbut this means very little to the general public. Tokens are more interest-\ning to the average man since they provide a touch of our earlier history\nbut again, only the rarities elicit appreciation from fellow-collectors. In\nthe field of paper money or medals, frequently you are able to display\nitems that are unusual or new to the senior collector, and this tends to\ngive them greater attraction for the general public as well.\n\nSandham, writing the first work on Canadian numismatics in 1869,\nincluded medals. In 1872, he brought out his monograph, McGill Col-\nlege and Its Medals. Leroux described medals in his books. Breton, in\nhis last edition, illustrated a large number of them.\n\nThere are two excellent publications on Indian Chief medals, \u2014\none issued in French by Dr. Victor Morin and the other in English by\nMr. Jamieson. The American Journal of Numismatics, The Numismatist,\nand The Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal contain many\narticles and descriptions of Canadian medals.\n\nCanada badly needs an up-to-date book on our medals, although\nthe earlier works published on the subject are useful references for a\nmajority of pieces struck up to that time. Today, you have an unlimited\nfield for collecting, research and study; interesting, reasonably priced\nexamples can be obtained almost anywhere. Very often, families have\nspecimens in their possession, or they can be obtained from fellow-col-\nlectors or from dealers.\n\nAmong the first artists to engrave medals in Canada was Jean-Marie\nArnault, who came to Canada from France and produced at Montreal,\nin 1840 and 1841, dies for two early temperance medals. In Toronto,\n\n\u2014 201 \u2014\n",

(later taken over by\nHenry Birks & Sons) \u2014 all of Montreal, \u2014 with P. W. Ellis & Co. and\nR. Smith & Co., both of Toronto, \u2014 were among the first firms in\nCanada to prepare and strike medals. While some of their work is\nbeautiful, other examples are crude, though interesting. The majority\nof Canadian medals were struck but a few have been cast, including the\n\u2019 oldest Canadian Labour medal.\n\nAt the beginning, I referred to the earliest Canadian medals, struck\nin France and Britain. These all commemorate historic exploits in\nCanada, such as the founding of Louisbourg, the capture of Oswego,\nFrontenac\u2019s deliverance of Quebec from Sir William Phipps\u2019 attack, and\nthe agreements or treaties with the Indian Chiefs. For years, the latter\ntype of medal has been considered the \u201ccream\u201d of the Canadian\nvarieties; they are all rare, highly attractive, and most of them are\nsizeable. These first medals are, indeed, part and parcel of our history.\nThe Confederation Medal, given to the founders of Canadian Confe-\nderation and to members of our First Senate and House of Commons,\nis another example of a later period; many consider it Canada\u2019s most\nbeautiful medal.\n\nFor this summary, I shall classify the remaining Canadian medals\nby groups.\n\nMedals of the Governors General: A series originated by Lord\nDufferin, who had two types made. Each succeeding Governor General\nordered his own design. At first, these were engraved by a member of\nthe Wyon family in England, and later by the Royal Canadian Mint.\nThey are among the most beautiful Canadian medals. A majority of\nthem come in gold, silver and bronze. They were and are awarded for\noutstanding scholarship, writing, rifle shooting, and for other achieve-\nments deemed worthy of approval by our Governors General.\n\nLieutenant Governors\u2019 Medals: A number of Lieutenant Governors\nof Canadian provinces have followed the Governor General\u2019s example\nin awarding special medals within their own provinces. Because of their\nlong continuity, those of the Lieutenant Governors of Quebec are the\nbest known.\n\nOther Medals of Award: A great many learned and professional\nsocieties in Canada have established their own annual awards in medal\nform. These are usually engraved and struck by the Royal Canadian\nMint. I would like to compliment our Mint upon the excellent work-\nmanship that goes into their medal production.\n\nMost of our educational institutions have given medals, often by\nmeans of a gift of money for that. purpose from some distinguished\n\n\u2014 202 \u2014\n",
    "241": "citizen. Agricultural societies, manufacturing organizations, athletic\nassociations and clubs, shooting organizations and many other groups\nhave or have had their medals of award, and for the most part these\nmerit our attention.\n\nCommemorative Medals: A substantial field in itself, since it com-\nprises a great many medals issued in connection with winter carnivals,\nexhibitions, Royal Visits, Coronations, music festivals, bridge construc-\ntion and on many other occasions of national, provincial or local interest. \u2014\n\nPolitical Medals: These are limited in Canada, but a few medals\nhave been issued to commemorate the work of our leading statesmen,\nor to win votes at elections.\n\nMilitary Decorations and Medals: A large field, and one of the\nmost fascinating. \u2018The first decoration given with a specifically Can-\nadian association was the enameled gold badge of the Baronetage of\nNova Scotia. In the main, this was bestowed upon Scottish peers who\nagreed to participate in the colonization of our Maritime Provinces, and\nwas instituted by King James I in 1624. As the name suggests, it carried\nwith it a baronetcy.\n\nAt a slightly later date and up to the end of the French r\u00e9gime in\nCanada, the French king gave the beautiful Order of Saint Louis to a\nnumber of the leaders in New France.\n\n~The Naval General Service Medal \u2014 the first awarded by the\nBritish government to men for fighting in seaborne engagements \u2014 was\ngiven with bars to commemorate actions fought during the War of\n1812-1814. Unfortunately, as with the Military General Service Medal\nwith bars for Chateauguay, Chrysler\u2019s Farm and Fort Detroit, it was\nnot awarded until many years afterwards so that only a few surviving\nparticipants received the award. \u2018These medals are among the most\ndesirable in the Canadian series.\n\nThe Canadian General Service Medals with bars for the Fenian\nRaids of 1866 and 1870, and for the Red River Rebellion of the latter\nyear, are another challenging group for the collector. To show how this\nfield can afford much of interest to the specialist, I might mention that\nmy own collection contains eighty odd examples of the Canadian General\nService Medal, obtained not only for the bars but also for regiments\nand ships. In the same way, I have collected the Northwest Rebellion\nMedal and South African War Medals awarded to Canadians.\n\nAnother engaging group of Canadian war medals are those of the\nEgyptian Campaign, which was the first occasion when Canada recruited\na group for overseas. These men were in three contingents, \u2014 one from\nPeterborough, one from Ottawa and one of Caughnawaga Indians from\nthe Reservation near Montreal.

British decorations bestowed upon Canadians for\noutstanding exploits, usually in military activities, form an especially\nattractive part of this type of collection.\n\nNon-Military Government Decorations, Orders and Medals: An\ninteresting but limited series. \u2018The Canadian Government has issued\nseveral medals of the kind, some of the more unusual examples being\ndesigned for presentation to Eskimos who aided in the study of Arctic\nanimal and bird life.\n\nThe Quebec Government has established a number of Orders to\nmark outstanding accomplishment and service in agriculture, education\nand colonization. Each of these Orders has its several classes.\n\nI hope that you now possess a sufficiently clear picture of the\nopportunities in collecting Canadian medals to confirm a desire for\npractical exploration in this sphere. The field is unlimited. You will\ncome across the most worthwhile examples in the most unexpected\nplaces. You can never hope for completeness, which makes the chal-\nlenge all the greater. That the Canadian people are becoming enthused\nwas amply shown recently in Montreal by public interest in my medals\nincluded with the Exhibition of Military and Historical Canadiana\npresented by the 17th Duke of Yorks Royal Canadian Hussars between\nthe 17th and 28th of last April. These medals were not only a focal\npoint of the display, but also received generous coverage on television,\nradio and in the daily press.\n\nTHE $25 CANADIAN BANK-NOTE is referred to in J. E. Charl-\nton\u2019s Catalogue (p. 14), Canada and Newfoundland Paper Money.\n\nIt is understood, through an official of the Bank of Canada, that\nthe English and French versions of these notes were ordered in the\nfollowing amounts :\n\nEnglish _. $3,500,000\nFrench _ a 500,000\n\nOnly $2,215,950 of the $4,000,000 ordered were issued and, at the\nend of 1955, $46,350 of these notes were still outstanding.\n\n\u2014 204 \u2014\n",
    "243": "Forms of Chinese Money\nup to A.D. 1600\n\nOutline of a talk given by A. E. H. Petrie\non April 9, 1956, to C.N.A. Chapter +1 of Ottawa\n\n(Continued from September issue)\n\nLet us now return to what is doubtless the commonest form of\nChinese money, and probably the most durable: cash pieces \u2014 the well-\nknown brass or copper round flan, with a square hole in the centre for\nstringing. These were first introduced as a type of small change during\nthe 3rd Century B.C. toward the close of the Chou Dynasty. Subse-\nquently, the copper cash secured official approval for exclusive use\nthroughout the Empire after its unification from a group of warring states\nby Ch\u2019in Shih Huang Ti, the First Emperor, about 220 B.C. Since then,\nuntil a century ago, it has been practically the only authorized form of\nmetallic money in China and the Far East. The main varieties and\ndevelopments of cash pieces over the past 2000 years are quite fascinating,\nand offer a great range of beautiful examples for the serious student. The\neatliest types, issued by certain of the Chinese states some 250 years\nbefore Christ, are round or oval in shape, as much as one to one and a\nquarter inches in diameter, bear inscriptions in great seal characters and\n\u2014 unlike later issues \u2014 some have round holes in the centre for stringing.\nWhen the First Emperor had unified China and completed the Great\nWall to keep out such invaders as the Huns (whose descendants captured\nRome 600 years later), the Pan Liang or \u201cHalf Ounce\u201d copper cash\nwith the square hole became the authorized form of money. After the\nfall in 208 B.C. of the Ch\u2019in Dynasty \u2014 which the First Emperor thought\nhe had founded to last for ten thousand generations \u2014the Pan Liang\nsuffered a rapid deterioration in size, weight and quality until, with the\nopening of the succeeding Han Dynasty about 200 B.C., they had\ndegenerated into little flakes of metal referred to as \u201celm seeds\u201d. A strong\ncentral authority remedied this situation for a few decades but by 118 B.C.,\nin the reign of the great Han Emperor Wu, the government decided to\nabandon the Pan Liang, introducing in its place the Wu Shu or Five Shu\n(a unit of weight) cash piece, which was to remain standard for more than\n700 years thereafter. This is true even though the Wu Shu itself under-\nwent many vicissitudes and forging was so common, despite the most\nfrightful penalties, that on at least one occasion the authorities, in despair,\nappointed the ablest forgers to work at the Mint! In popular esteem,\nthe Wu Shu remained both pleasing and practical. Until 1900, many of\nthem could still be found in circulation along with later varieties of cash.\n\n\u2014 205 \u2014\n",
    "244": "Whatever may be said about their fiscal policies, we must admit that the\nChinese certainly went in for durable kinds of money!\n\nThe same holds true of the K\u2019ai Yiian T\u2019ung Pao or \u201cCurrency of the\nInauguration\u201d, those handsome, clean-cut coins first struck to commemo-\nrate the beginning of the T\u2019ang \u2014 the next great Dynasty after the Han\n\u2014in A.D. 618. Kai Yiians are the representative copper coinage of the\nT\u2019ang period, when China enjoyed one of the most brilliant epochs of\nher history, from A.D. 600 to 900 \u2014 an age of fantastic luxury and terrible\ncivil wars, when the commerce of Asia and the Roman Orient flowed\nthrough the twin capitals of Ch\u2019ang-an and Loyang; then, the splendid\ncourts of Emperors T\u2019ai Tsung and Ming Huang received the fist\nChristian missionaries and sent Hsiian Tsang, the noble Buddhist pilgrim,\non his wondrous journey to India. Between 700 and 850, when Europe\nwas in its Dark Ages, there flourished in China some of the immortals of\nmankind: the poet Li T\u2019ai Po, whose winged lyrics are among the greatest\never written; Wu Tao-tzu, the supreme artist of East Asia, who could awe\nand overwhelm spectators with the sure swiftness and incredible grandeur\nof his work, of which only a few echoes and the traditions remain; Tu Fu,\nthe tragic poet, whose brief, profoundly moving depictions of the utter\nmisery and futility of war have never been equalled.\n\nRegarding the T\u2019ang coins, one might go so far as to say that, for the\nthoughtful and sensitive observer, their essential purity and simplicity of\ndesign, almost concealing an underlying strength and beauty of material\nand conception, all combine to reveal something of the very spirit of the\nage that produced them. At least, this is true for men of vision, who\nhave troubled to acquire the background knowledge that breathes life\ninto the dry bones of history; for others, the K\u2019ai Yiians can signify\nnothing more than an almost endless repetition of the same design !\nA few details will illustrate some interesting developments, in spite of the\nsuperficial sameness I have just mentioned: first, the characters on the\nK\u2019ai Yiian cash were written expressly for that purpose by the scholar\nOu-yang Hsiin after the design of Wei Ch\u00e9ng, who was prime minister\nand principal adviser to the Founder of the T\u2019ang Dynasty; secondly,\nmany of them are varied by having a small crescent mark on the reverse,\nsaid to have been left upon the wax model of the coin by W\u00e9n T\u00e9, the\nfirst T\u2019ang Empress, when she touched it with her finger nail; more\nimportant than either of these, however, is the first designation, by a\ncharacter on the reverse, of the different provincial mints from which\nmany of the issues came. I should point out that such mintmarks are\nfound chiefly upon special issues of K\u2019ai Yiians brought out during the\nlatter part of the Dynasty, and not upon the earliest ones of A.D. 618\nto 626.\n\nA pleasant little story inseparably links the memory of the Founder's\nEmpress with Wei Ch\u00e9ng, the capable minister who designed the K\u2019ai\nYiian. On one occasion, it is said, when the Emperor was deeply involved\n\n\u2014 206 \u2014\n",
    "245": "in administrative and family problems, Wei Ch\u00e9ng, asked for advice,\nspoke to his sovereign in very candid terms. The Emperor T\u2019ai Tsung\ngrew angry at being told what to do in such unflattering language, and\ndetermined to punish his chief adviser. \u2018The Empress, noticing her\nhusband\u2019s sombre looks, asked him what was wrong. Immediately upon\nhearing what had happened, she went to her apartments and was arrayed\nin robes of state. When he saw her returning to him so magnificently\nattired, T\u2019ai Tsung demanded to know the occasion for this display. The\nEmpress replied that only in this way should she come to offer congratula-\ntions to a ruler who inspired such loyalty in his subjects that they did\nnot hesitate to speak what they believed to be true, even though it might\nnot be pleasant to hear. T\u2019ai Tsung, touched by his wife\u2019s wisdom and\nbravery, bestowed fresh honours upon her and the minister whom she\nhad saved.\n\nDuring the 10th Century A.D., after the fall of the T\u2019ang, China was\nagain divided among rival rulers prior to reunification of the Empire under\nthe Sung, who in A.D. 960 ascended the throne to lead their people\nthrough one of the most cultured and sophisticated eras in human\nhistory. The Sung emperors were great patrons of learning and the arts:\ntheir benign rule encouraged creative activity in every field; the printing\nof fine books and production of superb porcelain attained heights of\nachievement unequalled before or since; in landscape painting their\nsubtlety, power and penetration are still unrivalled; with all this and\nmuch more to the credit of the ruling classes, it is not surprising to learn\nthat one of the emperors, Hui Tsung, who lived at the beginning of the\n12th Century, was the greatest artist who ever occupied a throne.\nUnfortunately, his political ineptitude brought about the end of the\nNorthern Sung Dynasty in 1126, when he and his art collections went off\ninto captivity among the nomad barbarians he had offended; his heir\nmanaged to flee to the beautiful city of Hangchow, just below the mouth\nof the Yangtze, where the Dynasty carried on until about 1276 before it\nwas overwhelmed by the Mongols under Kublai Khan. At that time the\nruins of the Sung civilization were to dazzle Marco Polo.\n\nReverting to our coins we find, as might be expected, that once the\nartloving Sungs had established their authority \u2014 in A.D. 990, to be exact\n\u2014 they introduced a new and extremely varied series of coins in several\nsizes, with inscriptions in the personal calligraphy of each successive\nemperor, and these in three styles \u2014 seal, orthodox and grass \u2014 for his\nown reign periods. Let us consider for a moment the three kinds of\ncharacters or calligraphy found on Sung money; they are: seal characters,\nin a decorative but formal style roughly corresponding to our Gothic\nlettering; the orthodox hand, used for regular printed characters, wherein\nit may be equated with our Roman letters; and the running or grass hand,\na sort of Chinese shorthand in rapid, flowing style, which permitted great\nfreedom although it makes difficult reading for the uninitiated. During\n\n\u2014 207 \u2014\n",
    "246": "the 11th and 12th Centuries, the great age of Sung prosperity, their mints\npoured forth a ceaseless stream of remarkably beautiful cash pieces in\nboth copper and iron, large and small, all exhibiting a great variety of\nreign periods superbly inscribed in the three styles previously mentioned.\n\nAs the Mongols encroached upon the Chinese domains in the early\n13th Century most of these refinements in the coinage disappear, though\nyear dates on the reverse become the rule. From 1280 to the end of the\nCentury under Kublai Khan, the famous Mongol Emperor, paper currency\nreplaced copper. This state of affairs changed with subsequent Mongol\nrulers, who have left us some quite attractive large cash pieces.\n\nHung Wu, founder of the Ming Dynasty in 1368, struck several sizes\nof cash and authorized a large number of thousand-cash paper notes, a few\nof which have managed to survive to the present day. For better or\nworse, governments of the time could not resist the temptation to print\na surplus of paper money over fiscal assets. After a lengthy series of\nunhappy experiences, paper currency went out of fashion in China until\na century ago; since then, events have merely stressed the inflationary\ncharacter of banknotes there.\n\nOf Ming cash pieces little need be said save that, up to 1600, they\nare mainly of four reigns \u2014those of Hung Wu (1368-1398), Yung Lo\n(1403-1425), Hsiian T\u00e9 (1425-1436) and Wan Li (1573-1620). If cash of\nother reigns prior to 1500 are found, these were specially minted after\n1520 and not during the period whose name is given on them.\n\nWith Yung Lo, we encounter two distinct types of cash: one of fine\nexecution in good bronze, the other of somewhat careless execution in\ninferior metal. Since the two types are readily distinguished from one\nanother, we need not go into their technical names, which merely indicate\nthe methods used in making them.\n\nI have thought it best to end this survey of Chinese money with the\nyear 1600, since it closes a convenient period of 3000 years if we take\nChinese currencies back to cowries about 1400 B.C., while A.D. 1600\nmarks the beginning of modern times in China, as for the rest of the\nworld. With the arrival of Western merchants and Christian missionaries\nin China toward the year 1600, her old isolation ended for 350 years until\n1949, when the Soviet interests took over. \u2018Those 350 years saw the\nproduction of such a huge range of new coins and paper currency that at\nleast one more talk like this would be necessary to review them in the\nmost cursory fashion.\n\nIn conclusion, I should like to give you a few references on early\nChinese coins, if any of you should care to pursue this inexpensive and\npleasurable recreation. They are the following:\n\n\u2014 208 \u2014\n",

The London Numismatic Society had prepared\nan interesting programme and Association business was effectively\nreviewed at the business sessions. Bourse dealers reported business to be\nsatisfactory, one claiming to have done better than at a larger convention\nheld shortly before in the United States. Auction were spirited: many\nnew highs were attained in the bidding, though some reversals of price\ntrends also appeared. \u2018There was an excellent sightseeing trip by bus, with\na special stop at the new Thames locks. Our ladies made the most of\ntheir time for shopping and visiting some of the many places of interest\nin and around that beautiful city.\n\nThe Association\u2019s Annual Banquet proved to be an outstanding event.\nFollowing grace and a toast to the Queen, our executives and members\nsat down to a delicious dinner. Mayor Dennis of London tendered an\nofficial welcome to the delegates, and hoped that they might all live to\nredeem the souvenir wooden nickels beside each place when London\ncelebrates her 200th Anniversary in 2054. Mr. Walter Holmes, President\nof the London Numismatic Society, expressed pleasure at the Convention\u2019s\nlarge attendance. President G. R. L. Potter spoke of the Association\u2019s\nphenomenal growth since its inception in 1950. Mr. Vincent G. Greene,\nC.N.A., Vice-President, was happy to see so many American members\npresent. Major S. S. Carroll, a past president of the Association, gave\na most interesting and humorous main address on the C.N.A.\u2019s develop-\nment from small beginnings in Ottawa a decade ago to our present\norganization, one of the largest of its kind in the world, with nearly a\nthousand active members. If our expansion of the past year is any\ncriterion, coming conventions should witness further rises in the quality\nof exhibits and in the numbers of visitors who attend.\n\nWith the coming of Fall and the resumption of our Chapter and\nClub activities, we again invite and urge C.N.A. Secretaries across the\ncountry to send in their meeting reports regularly. Please let us know\nabout any special functions that you may be planning. Try and submit\nyour speakers\u2019 talks to the Editor for use in the Journal, and encourage\nmembers to write articles on their specialties for our publication: in this\nway, your Chapter or Club will have worthwhile talks and discussions,\nand the Canadian Numismatic Journal will be able to offer good reading\nmaterial to our extensive membership on this continent and abroad.\n\n\u2014 217 \u2014\n",
    "260": "No move Chapters\n\nThe chapter system was originally adopted as a means of building up\nC.N.A. membership. As an inducement, a slight reduction in the annual\ndues was offered to those clubs having and maintaining 100 per cent\nC.N.A. membership, and as these members would receive the same\nservices as individual members it was agreed that the Association could\ncompensate for any loss in revenue by bulk mailing to chapter secretaries.\n\nThis last provision was never put into effect until this year, when\nit became imperative that all unnecessary expense be eliminated. It soon\nbecame evident that the new procedure was highly unpopular, and that\nchapters preferred to pay the difference and resume the direct mailing\nthat had hitherto obtained. In these circumstances, and in view of the\nfact that the amendment permitting 80 per cent membership instead\nof 100, passed in 1955, virtually destroyed the very basis of the chapter\nidea, the London Convention unanimously decided that the chapter form\nof organization no longer served any useful purpose, and should therefore\nbe abolished.\n\nBeginning with 1957, therefore, all C.N.A. members will pay the\nfull dues as set at the Annual Meeting, and no further chapters will be\ncreated. It is, of course, open to any of the present chapters to retain\nthe name, if they wish.\n\nNumismatic Exhibition at Victoria, B.C.\n\nOne of the best numismatic displays ever shown in British Columbia\nwill be offered to the public in Victoria from November 11 to 25. The\nexhibition is being planned by the Victoria Numismatic Society to interest\nnew members in coin collecting and also to make available to the general\npublic an authentic display of the Province\u2019s early coins, tokens and paper\nmoney. Feature of the show will be the often-discussed but seldom seen\nB.C. gold patterns, the $10 and $20 in gold, besides strikes in silver and\ngilt bronze of these early B.C. coins. We plan to have a wide range of\nearly banknotes, too, including the rare MacDonald Bank items. More\nthan one hundred B.C. tokens and trade certificates will be on display.\n\nThis exhibition has been made possible through the courtesy and\ncooperation of the British Columbia Archives; it will be the first time\nsuch a complete range of B.C. numismatic material has been shown\nanywhere. To this end, also, we are enjoying the full support of our\nProvince\u2019s leading numismatists, who have placed many choice items\nfrom their personal collections at our disposal.

    "261": "A proposed Classification of Canadian\nand Newfoundland Die Varieties\n\nAn excellent article by H. C. Taylor, \u201cVarieties or Variations\u201d,\nappeared in the C.N.A. Bulletin of October 1955. The writer had a\nsimilar article under way at the time; since his views are so closely in\nharmony with those of Mr. Taylor, only the following summary of this\narticle is offered. It is hoped that this proposed system may form a basis\nfor classification of the varieties at present on record, as well as for any\nthat may turn up in the future.\n\nClass 1. Variations resulting from deliberate action on the part of the\nmint authorities:\nA. Mint marks.\n1. \u2018H\u2019 identifying coins struck at Heaton\u2019s Mint, Birmingham, England.\n2. \u2018C\u2019 identifying coins, other than Canadian, struck at the Ottawa Mint.\nPrior to establishment of the Ottawa Mint in 1908, the coins of\nCanada and Newfoundland were struck at the London Mint (no mint\nmark) or Heaton\u2019s Mint. Certain of the coins of Newfoundland from\n1917 on were struck at Ottawa, and all bear the \u2018C\u2019 mint mark except\nthe cent and ten cents of 1940, and the cent of 1942. The Prince\nEdward Island cent of 1871 was struck at Heaton\u2019s Mint, but is\nunique in bearing no mint mark.\nB. Markings placed on the dies to indicate that the date of the die was not the\ndate of the coin.\n1. Dot on certain 1936 dies to indicate that the coins were struck in 1937.\n2. Maple leaf after date on all 1947 dies to indicate the coins were struck\nin 1948,\nC. Variation in metal of coins.\n1. Five cents of 1942 in both nickel and tombac.\n2. Five cents of 1951 in both nickel and chromium plated steel.\nD. Variation in size of coin.\n1. Large and small cents (of different design) in 1920.\n\u20182. Slight change in size of 25c. in 1953.\n\nClass 2. Major variations in design.\n\nA. Difference in type or number of leaves in wreath.\n1. Coarse and fine leaves on 1891 cent.\n2. Ten cents of 1891 comes with 21 and 22 leaves.\n3. Ten cents of 1909 and 1913 come with both large and small leaves.\n\nB. Differences in width or type of rim.\n1. Five cents of 1870 comes with flat and wire edge.\nClass 3. Minor variations in dies of one year.\n\nA. Differences in size, shape, spacing, alinement, position, or style of numerals.\n\nB. Differences in size, shape, spacing, alinement, position, or style of lettering or\npunctuation.\n\nC. Recut or re-engraved numerals.\nD. Recut or re-engraved lettering or punctuation.\nE. Differences in size or placing of mint marks.\n\nClass 4. Variations due to treatment of the dies or to the coining process.\n\nA. Elimination or weakening of part of design in polishing the die.\nB. Cracking of the die.\n\nC. Filling of portions of the design by adventitious matter, resulting in weakening\nor even total elimination of part of the design.\n\n\u2014 219 \u2014\n",
    "262": "The majority of the varieties reported are associated with Class 3A,\nand it seems likely that \u2018date\u2019 varieties will always be most numerous.\nVariations in the placing of the final figure in the date on the current\nfifty-cent piece are extremely common, and more and more will probably\nturn up as time goes on. It is suggested that to be worth noting such\nvarieties should be recognizable by the unaided eye.\n\nThe question of what constitutes a \u2018complete\u2019 collection of any series\nis not an easy one, where many major or minor varieties exist, and in the\nlast analysis will be decided by the collector himself. However, the writer\nwould suggest that all varieties falling in Class 1 should be necessary to\n\u2018completeness\u2019, even though such items as the dot cent and ten cents\ndated 1936 are virtually unobtainable. The rarity of these coins almost\ncertainly results from the clogging of the minute punchmark early in\nthe run.\n\nAs varieties falling in Class 2 represent major changes, they too have\na claim to a place in a \u2018complete\u2019 collection.\n\nVarieties falling in Class 3 may be considered as fortuitous, as they\nresult largely from those differences that are almost inseparable from\nhand work, however skilful the worker: they might, therefore, be\nconsidered as secondary varieties. Varieties in Class 4 are definitely due\nto mechanical imperfections of one sort or another, and cannot normally |\nbe considered as especially important, although the dot coinage may\nperhaps be \u2018the exception that proves the rule\u2019.\n\nEvery effort has been made, in drawing up this proposed classification,\nto proceed in a logical manner. However, certain types of variation will\nstill have a question mark when one tries to place them. For example,\ndo we place the small date 1891 cents with coarse and fine leaves in\nClass 2 or Class 32 A case may be made out for either classification,\nand doubtless readers will find other \u2018border-line\u2019 cases. If the classifica-\ntion be considered not as something final, but as a basis for discussion\nthat may lead to a generally accepted classification, the writer will feel\nwell rewarded.\n\nJerome H. Remicx III.\n\nNew Members please note\n\nIt is regretted that the August issue of the Journal was not adequate\nto supply all new members with a full run for 1956.

The United\nKingdom is probably unique in resort to a private body, the London\nLivery Company of the Goldsmiths.\n\nThe institution of the English trial of the Pyx\u2014the box in which\nsamples are locked up \u2014 is attributed by Chisholm to Henry II (1154-89).\nAn origin quite so early is improbable. At the date, about 1179, of the\nDialogue on the Exchequer, the weight and fineness of much of the\nmoney received by the Exchequer were regularly examined under the eyes\nof the Barons of the Exchequer. The purpose was to fix the value at\nwhich each contribution should be accepted. Coins were not arranged\nunder mints or minters, and the test was not directed to verifying the\nstandard of: their work, although proceedings were possible against a\nminter whose name was still legible on light coin; the silence of the\nDialogue shows that no other trial of mint output existed. Moreover,\nthe Treasurer and author was extremely hazy on limits of variation of\nweight and fineness, and there clearly was not in existence any directive\non which a trial could operate. Indeed, assay in England involving, as it\ndid then, the entire destruction of coin by the pound weight, was \u2018still\nuseless for direction and control of mint operations.\n\nDuring a demonetization and recoinage nearly seventy years later: a\ntrial of the old and the new coin was staged in 1248 in presence of the\nBarons of the Exchequer and of a sworn jury of twelve honest citizens\nelected by the municipality of London and of twelve or thirteen\ngoldsmiths of standing. The object was less to ascertain how far each\nmint had complied with standards than to convince the country at large,\nwhich was paying heavily for currency reform, that the fineness of coin\nhad risen. As standards of reference, a pair of bars, one of pure silver\n\n\u2014 221 \u2014\n",

Similar pairs of\nbars of 2 ounces weight were furnished for their guidance to the mints\nof London and eighteen other towns..\n\nA trial before the King\u2019s Council of the Pyx of coins set aside by the\nLondon Mint must have been instituted between this date and 1279. In\nthat year Edward I gave orders:\n\n(i) That trial plates of coin fineness, but no longer of pure silver,\nshould be made and kept in the Exchequer as standards or controls in\nthe tests of coin and other like plates furnished to mints for their\nguidance; the Exchequer plate for pence is preserved in the Royal Mint.\n\n(ii) That the master of the Mint should put aside out of every\n10 pounds of silver coin produced one penny or four farthings in a chest\nwith two, or from the fourteenth century three, locks and keys, each held\nby a different official of the Mint.\n\n(iii) That a good assayer should be appointed to the Mint, and\ninclude in his duty the examination and assay of the contents of this box\nfour times a year in presence of the Barons of the Exchequer.\n\nThat the trial was no innovation appears from the writ issued to\nthese Barons in 1280 which commands them to open the Pyxes of London\nand Canterbury and hold the assay \u2018in such manner as the King\u2019s Council\nwere wont to do\u2019. It was transferred back to the King\u2019s Council by 1344.\n\n. \u00bb The assay of the sample coins was made before the Barons or Lords\nby: the assayer of the Mint until after 1432. In 1475 it was made by a\njury of four goldsmiths; in 1534 the jury had grown to sixteen goldsmiths,\none gold refiner and twelve members of other London livery companies\n\u2014 six. mercers, two grocers, one scrivener and one haberdasher; by 1580\nthe other companies had dropped out and the jury has since been named\nby the goldsmiths and wholly from their livery.\n\nCaveat Emptor\n\nThe Journal is not trying to go highbrow on its readers. The mystic\ntitle is simply the Latin for that very sensible adage \u201cLet the buyer beware\u2019.\n\nWith the terrific rise in the values of certain Canadian coins, the\ntemptation to supply the demand by faking appears to be spreading.\nThe Association has been notified of several cases of altered dates, such\nas a fifty-cent piece of 1920 being altered so as simulate the very rare 1921,\nand doubtless other swindles of the same kind will be tried. Collectors\nto whom such coins are offered should therefore be on their guard. No\nreputable dealer will object to giving a cast-iron guarantee that the piece\nhe is, offering is genuine. Unless such a guarantee is forthcoming, the\npiece should be refused, and the matter reported to the Association.\n\n\u2014 222 \u2014\n",

In 1770, following a petition by the\ninhabitants, Prince Edward Island was declared a Province, and in 1785\nsimilar action was taken with respect to New Brunswick.\n\nNewfoundland, discovered by John Cabot in 1497, has been \u201ca\nBritish possession since 1583, when formal possession was taken in the\nname of Queen Elizabeth by Sir Humphrey Gilbert. The .colony was\ngranted self-government in 1855, and in.1949, following a Plehacit\nbecame the tenth Canadian province.\n\nBritish Columbia was originally colonized by the Spanish, and many\nplace names still recall this phase, but \u2018it has been a British colony for\nmost of its history. It was created a Crown Colony in 1858, and entered\nConfederation in 1873.\n\nAt Confederation, all the provinces found themselves beset by similar\nmonetary problems. All adopted the decimal system in place of sterling\nwithin five years, except for Prince Edward Island, which retained the\nsterling system for seven years. \u2018The British Columbia gold rush of 1858\nbrought thousands of California miners to the diggings, and naturally\nwhen a change in currency was deemed necessary the United States\ndecimal system was adopted. An Assay Office was established at New\nWestminster, and here were struck the famous. gold pattern ten- and\ntwenty-dollar pieces that constitute some of the greatest rarities in\nBritish North American numismatics.\n\n\u2014 223 \u2014\n",
    "266": "Prior to the conquest of 1759, the colony of New France had had\nmany coinage difficulties, and these had led to many odd expedients,\nsuch as the now excessively rare \u2018playing card\u2019 money. The situation was\nnot improved following the Treaty of Paris and, in fact, there was a\ngrave shortage of currency right up to the War of 1812, when the military\nauthorities had to issue \u2018army scrip\u2019 to pay the troops and to secure\nnecessary supplies. This scrip proved so popular that there was a strong\ndemand for its continuance after the cessation of hostilities.\n\nIn 1787, Nova Scotia passed an act of the legislature dealing with\ncurrency (Act 28, George III, Cap. 9). By this measure, sterling was\nequated with \u2018Halifax Currency\u2019. This derived from the extensive circul-\nation of the Spanish milled dollar, or piece of eight reales, which was\nvalued at five shillings currency or 4/6 sterling. The new Act laid down\nthe following table of rates:\n\nSterling Halifax Currency _\u2014 Sterling \u2014 Halifax Currency\n\nCrown 5/6 Shilling 1/1\nHalf-crown 2/9 Sixpence -/6\u00a52\n\nThese rates stemmed from a valuation originally set up by Sir Isaac\nNewton in 1704, while he was Master of the Mint.\n\nIn 1777, Halifax Currency was adopted generally in Canada, the\ndollar being reduced from 6/- to 5/- by Ordinance 17, George III, Cap. 9:\nthis instrument listed British and French crowns at 5/6, the French\n4 livres 10 sols (tournois) at 4/2, the 36 sols at 1/8, the 24 sols at 1/1,\nthe shilling at 1/1, and the pistareen, a debased 2-real piece, at 1/-. It\nestablished the following exchange rates for certain gold coins : Johannes\nof Portugal \u00a34; Moidore of. Portugal \u00a31-10; Doubloon or 4-pistole piece\n\u00a33-12; Guinea \u00a31-3-4; Louis d\u2019or \u00a31-2-6.\n\nHalifax Currency was actually a money of account. The rating of\nthe dollar at five shillings worked well in everyday transactions, but did\nnot work so well from the conversion standpoint. Moreover, metallic\ncurrency in Upper Canada was complicated by the existence concurrently\nof two systems of accounting:\n\nHalifax Currency, which divided the pound currency into 20 shillings currency,\nor four Spanish dollars rated at five shillings currency;\n\nNew York Currency, the unit of which was the \u2018York Shilling\u2019 whose equivalent\nwas the Mexican real, eight of which went to a Spanish milled dollar. Twenty York\nShillings made a New York Currency pound. As the York Shilling was worth but\nTYed. in Halifax, the New York pound was rated at 12/6 in Halifax Currency.\n\n~ 224 \u2014\n",

The rating established in 1787 was repealed\nby Act 7, George IV, Cap. 19. These measures left the Province without\nany legal currency.\n\nIn 1834, as a result of certain monetary measures put into effect in\nthe United States, Nova Scotia enacted Provincial Act 4, William IV,\nCap. 61, part of which read as follows:\n\nWhereas the adoption of British sterling money in the currency and monies of\naccount of and throughout all His Majesty\u2019s domains would be highly useful, and\ntend to unite more closely the interests of the Colonies with those of the Mother\nCountry... to make such alteration in the currency of this Province at present would\nbe inconvenient and inexpedient, unless the same was adopted in the adjoining\nProvinces; and whereas in the meantime, and until such changes shall be made in the\ncurrency of other Colonies, it is requisite and necessary to establish a standard of values\nand an equivalent for property, which may be obtained by fixing a value upon foreign\ngold and British silver coins; be it therefore enacted that the British shilling be equal\nto 1/3 currency, the British sixpence be equal to 744d. currency, with a limit of \u00a350 in\nlegal tender.\n\nSpanish doubloons were to equal \u00a34 currency or \u00a33-4-0 sterling.\n\nIn 1836, Provincial Act 6, William IV, Cap. 41 rated the pound\nsterling at 25 shillings currency to conform with the 1834 rates for silver,\nsince Halifax Currency had declined in two years to as little as forty\nshillings to the pound sterling, and measures to control the situation were\ndeemed necessary. In spite of this precaution, it was still hard to obtain\nBritish silver.\n\nIn 1839, because of the undervaluation of the dollar, Nova Scotia\nAct 2, Victoria, Cap. 37 authorized the payment of Treasury notes in\ndollars and not at their old value in Halifax Currency of 5/-, with current\nrates fluctuating between 5/1 and 5/3.\n\nIn 1842, by Act 5, Victoria, Cap. 8, the Provincial Legislature set\nthe following exchange rates: gold\u2014doubloons \u00a34 currency, \u00a33-4-0 sterling;\nsovereigns \u00a31-5-0 currency, \u00a31 sterling; silver\u2014Peruvian, Columbian,\nMexican, and Old Spanish dollars 5/2\u00a5Y2 currency, 4/2 sterling; shillings\n1/3 currency, 1/- sterling; copper\u2014the penny and halfpenny to pass at\nface value in either currency or sterling.\n\n\u2014 225 \u2014\n",
    "268": "In 1859, by Act 22, Victoria, Cap. 24, public accounts were to be\nkept in dollars and cents with an optional column for pounds, shillings,\nand pence; the pound was to be rated at $5.00 and other sterling in\nproportion. In 1860, Act 23, Victoria, Cap. 3 made the dollar and its\nconstituent parts the sole denominations of money, and set the following\nexchange rates: \u00a31\u2014$5, crown $1.25, half-crown 622 cents, florin 50 cents,\nshilling 25 cents, sixpence 12Y% cents, fourpence 8 cents: doubloons were\nto be valued at $16 or \u00a33-4-0, and various dollars at $1.04 or 4/2, with a\nlimit of $10 in legal tender value for British silver. \u2018This Act also\nprovided for the minting of token subsidiary coins of one cent and\none-half cent. These were issued, according to the official figures, as\nfollows:\n\nYear. Cent Half Cent\n\n1861 $ 8,000 $2,000\n1862 $10,000\n1864 $ 8,000 $2,000\n\nIt should be added that collectors have never been.able to reconcile\nthe official figure for the minting of the 1862 cent with its scarcity in\nrelation to those of 1861 and 1864. ,\n\nIt will be noted from the above that United States currency was\nnever adopted or accorded legal status in Nova Scotia. The currency was\nbased on the Spanish dollar. Following Confederation, the government\nof Canada discharged debts in Nova Scotia at a rate of 73 cents for every\n\n75 cents in Nova Scotia currency.\n(To be continued)\n\nOn Canada\u2019s First Coins\n\n(from Adam Shortt\u2019s Documents relating to Canadian Currency, Exchange and Finance\nduring the French Period)\n\nIn 1670, the French government again tackled the problem of a special coinage for\nthe American possessions, including Canada. But the same conflict of interests arose\nbetween the different classes in the colony. Thanks to the stimulus which the ready\nmoney of de Tracy\u2019s soldiers had given to the substitution of cash for the previously\nprevalent barter and payment in kind, a distinctly mercantile class was growing up in\nCanada whose interests were often very naturally at variance with those of the habitant,\nthe craftsman and the labourer. The former strongly advocated increased supplies of\nstandard French coinage, which they could return to France for new supplies of goods.\nThe latter would be quite content with a special currency confined to the functions of\ninternal exchange, if only the retail merchants would accept it for their wares; but\nthis, they were not prepared to do.\n\nThe government had been accustomed to conduct its financial operations largely\nby barter, paying for purchases with standard goods on a cost basis. So long as this\nsystem was honestly carried out by the government officials, it was to the benefit of the\nsettlers. It correspondingly curtailed, however, the functions of the merchants, who\nnaturally desired that the government should adopt the system of paying for its purchases\nin cash. The inevitable conflict of class interests in these matters is brought out in the\ndocuments between 1670 and 1680. In the decree of 2nd December, 1680, comparative\nstability was established when all the coins in the colony were declared to be current\non the same relative basis as in France, at a uniform increase of one-third in value.\n\n\u2014 226 \u2014\n",

Chapter and Club Keports\n\nCHAPTER No. 1 (Ottawa) held its second meeting of the 1956-1957\nSeason at the Public Archives .on October 15, with some forty members\nand guests in attendance. Four of our twelve guests who registered took\nout C.N.A. memberships during the evening; these were Messrs. J. F.\nFilippino, E. C. Forrest, R. D. McAuley and N. T. Proudfoot.\n\nThrough the courtesy of Major S. S. Carroll, those present saw a\none-hour film on Counterfeiting, produced for training purposes by the\nInternational Criminal Police Association. This film was episodic in\ncharacter, illustrating the different methods used by forgers in making\nimitation coins and paper money, and the means by which they can\nbe detected.\n\nMr. G. R. L. Potter spoke briefly on the C.N.A.\u2019s London Conven-\ntion, and expressed our regret at the departure of Major Carroll to\nLondon, Ontario, where he will become D. A. G. for Military District\nNo. 1 as of November, 1956. Mr. Potter made a presentation to\nMajor Carroll on behalf of the Ottawa Chapter, and the evening closed\nwith the serving of refreshments, including cakes and cookies provided by\nseveral of the ladies.\n\nA.

A nominating\ncommittee was. appointed to designate suitable officers for 1957 at our\nNovember meeting, for elections to be held in December. Mr. Alfred\nBook presented a demonstration of methods used in lacquering coins;\nthis was received with close attention and aroused considerable discussion.\n\nMiss Thelma PELLETIER,\nSecretary.\n\nCHAPTER No. 7 (Vancouver) resumed its regular monthly\nmeetings on October 7 in the Labour Temple, under the direction of\nPresident R. Eveleigh. \u2018There were more than forty friends present, and\nthe following nine new members joined at this gathering: Mrs. C. Lamont,\nMiss M. Waters, and Messrs. W. Blair, L. Copan, A. Hicks, G. Kessel,\nC. Moore, K. Parsons and A. Phillips. We are fast nearing the hundred\nmark in our Chapter membership.\n\nTwo supposed \u201cdot\u201d ten cent pieces of 1936 were examined, but in\nneither case could the presence of a dot be verified.

I was very sensible of the honour you did me in elect-\ning me, and so far as my limited abilities go I have done my best to justify\n\nyour choice.\n\nMy term of office would normally expire in September 1957. How-\never, circumstances have arisen that make it impossible for me to continue\nas President beyond the end of this year, and I am therefore retiring on\n\nDecember 31 next.\n\nIn leaving office, it is a great satisfaction to know that the affairs of\nthe organization will now be under the direction of Mr. Vincent G.\nGreene, at present Vice-President of the Association. As all those who\nknow him will agree, Mr. Greene is admirably equipped to fill the office,\nto which he will succeed by virtue of Section b of By-law No. 3. I know\nthat you will all give him the same generous and effective support that you\nhave given me, and I fully expect to see our Association, now one of the\nlargest in the world, with nearly 1,000 active members, go forward under\n\nhis leadership to even greater heights.\n\nG.

    "284": "Editors Page\n\nThe Reader\u2019s Digest, Canadian Edition, for November bears in colour\non its outside cover 52 Canadian coins and tokens. These were photo-\ngraphed at Montreal\u2019s Chateau de Ramezay under the direction of Mr.\nFred Bowman, F.R.N.S., Curator of this museum\u2019s important numismatic\ncollections; all of the pieces illustrated are described on an inside page of\nthe magazine. These include examples of the principal types of Cana-\ndian coinage from the Louis XIV silver 15 sols of 1670 down through the\nyears to money bearing the likeness of Queen Elizabeth II. Tradesmen\u2019s\ntokens, Provincial issues prior to Confederation and semi-official varieties\nare well represented. The whole cover is remarkably warm and attractive\nin effect; the selection of coins makes a fascinating pageant of Canadian\nhistory.\n\nPostmark, publication of Canada\u2019s Postal Department, presents in its\nAugust-September issue an article on Numismatics by R. C. Mackenzie of\nRegina. This outlines the development of Canadian numismatics as the\nauthor appreciated it after viewing the private collection of Mr. Martin\nWatts, Secretary-Treasurer of the Regina Coin Club. Mr. Watts and Mr.\nCecil Tannahill, two of the Association\u2019s leading members in Saskat-\nchewan, recently presented a numismatic display over television to the\nPrairies. This was so well received that a further telecast on coins is being\n\nplanned.\n\nEarly in September, it was reported that a Swedish bank had honoured\na $500 banknote issued in 1864 by the Confederate States of America, and\npaid for it in full at the present face value in U.S. dollars equivalent to\n2750 Swedish kroner. Then, in October, a Detroit, Michigan, bank teller\nwas presented with what she took to be a Canadian $1,000 bill: this she\nbroke into United States $50 and $100 notes, adding the $20 premium for\nCanadian funds. The banknote in question turned out to be a Brazilian\nmilreis, worth about $11.50.\n\n\u2014 238 \u2014\n",
    "285": "Communion Cokens\nby H. C. Tayior\n\nWhile my dictionary describes a token, in the monetary sense, as\n\u201ca piece of metal intended for currency and issued at a face value in\nexcess of its real value\u201d (the sense in which collectors associate them with\ncoins), it is also defined as something given or shown as a symbol of right\nor good faith, \u2014 an evidence, a sign. It is the evidence of some right or\nprivilege granted to the holder: of a promise to be fulfilled, a means of\nidentifying the owner as one who has conformed to certain requirements,\nor as one to whom certain rights or privileges have been granted.\n\nWe learn from ancient documents that the Greeks and Romans\nemployed tokens to identify those who had been initiated into the secret\nmysteries of oath-bound societies, the winners at public games, and for\nthe admittance of invited guests to the emperor\u2019s palace; they were also\ngiven as an official authorization to persons granted the right to sell cer-\ntain commodities, and to the poor as licence to beg or as an order to be\nexchanged for food. They served to identify Roman soldiers entrusted\nwith the guarding of army camps at night, and as an indication that these\nmen were considered to be reliable by their officers.\n\nIn mediaeval times, tokens were often bestowed upon those sent on\nconfidential missions or religious pilgrimage, to identify them and to\nensure their being given protection and hospitality by members of the\nsame fraternity in other lands. \u2018Tokens for outstanding service were handed\ndown from one generation to the next, and those far from home could\nalways be sure of a warm welcome or of having their wants supplied pro-\nviding they could produce this proof that they or their fathers had\nexchanged assistance with others elsewhere. Early government and church\nrecords mention the use of tokens in France and England during the 15th\nCentury.\n\nWhen tokens are mentioned, collectors think of the hundreds of such\npieces issued by banks and merchants years ago as small change, for ferry\npassage, bridge tolls and bar checks \u2014 to be exchanged for goods at the\nowner\u2019s store or to advertise his business. Still another class of tokens\n\u2014not as well known nor used to take the place of money \u2014 were the\nchurch tokens, \u2014 \u201ccommunion\u201d tokens as they were commonly called.\n\nThe need for some safeguard of Christian privileges seems to have\nbeen recognized in the early history of the Church. Freedom of religious\nworship was possible only when it adhered to the wishes of the many prin-\nces and rulers who held sway over Europe in former times. \u2018Those who\nseparated from the Church of Rome, establishing denominations of their\nown so that they might worship in accordance with the light of their own\nfaith, were spied upon and persecuted. To exclude unbelievers from their\n\n\u2014 239 \u2014\n",
    "286": "communion services, some means of identifying their followers \u2014 of allow-\ning them, but no others to enter the church, had to be found. John\nCalvin, the French reformer, who travelled extensively through Europe,\npreaching and winning converts to his faith, proposed at a convention in\nGeneva in 1560: \u201cTo prevent the profanation of the Lord\u2019s Table it would\nbe well if each took lead tokens for each eligible one in their households;\nstrangers giving witness of their faith could also take these, but those not\nprovided with tokens would not be admitted.\u201d There are records of such\npieces being used by The Reformed Church of France as early as that year.\nTokens dating as far back as 1586 have been found in Holland, where they\nwere used by non-conformist refugees who fled there from France, England\nand Scotland to escape persecution. On the other hand, Cardinal Pole is\nsaid to have used them in the 1550s during Queen Mary\u2019s reign to identify\nthose who conformed from those who did not. He appointed every parish\npriest to keep account of those who were not attending communion ser-\nvice at the prescribed churches.\n\nThe books of St. Saviour\u2019s Church, Southwark, show that 2200 com-\nmunion tokens were sold at two pence each in 1596, and almost 2000 at\nthree pence each in 1620. The parish accounts of a church in Berkshire\nshow an entry of 300 tokens purchased for three shillings sixpence in 1658.\nAccordingly, the use of such tokens by the English churches seems to have\ndeveloped during the latter half of the 16th Century. Their purpose,\nprimarily, was to distinguish between those who had the right to be present\nand partake of communion and those who did not, and also between one\nparish and another.\n\nMany of the churches adopted the practice of collecting a fee for the\ntokens and insisted upon the attendance of all their members at com-\nmunion services, thereby ensuring that everyone contributed their full share\nof funds toward the maintenance of the church. However, at least one\nchurch employing them distributed the communion tokens to members as\nnotice of a forthcoming sacrament, though they were only handed to those\nconsidered to be in a state of grace and worthy to receive them. It was\nthe duty of the minister to provide the tokens. Some had them made\nlocally, which is usually evident from their plain appearance. Early pieces\nare mostly made of lead or pewter, iron, or even leather, but by the 19th\nCentury more efficient methods of manufacture gave the tokens a better\nappearance: then, they were mainly of white metal, with some in copper\nor brass. Those of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in New York were\nmade of ivory.\n\nIn the Scottish Church of a century ago, as a rule, communion was\ndispensed but once a year, sometimes less often. Prior to such services,\nexaminations took place to test the candidates\u2019 knowledge of the Bible,\nwith the ultimate purpose of deciding who might be worthy of the sacra-\nment. Members were usually required to recite the Shorter Catechism,\nthe Lord\u2019s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. Distribution of the\n\nne HY me\n",
    "287": "tokens followed, and no person was admitted to the communion service\nwithout one. After the service, tokens would be gathered up for use on\nthe next occasion. Because of the length of time between these com-\nmunion services and the large numbers of people who attended them, it\nwas customary and necessary to have several \u201csittings\u201d or \u201ctables\u201d to\naccommodate all of the participants. For this reason, some tokens bear\nsuch indications as \u201cTable 2\u201d, \u201cTable 3\u201d, or \u201cTable 9\u201d. It is recorded that\nupon a day in 1775 the Reverend John Mills preached six times and served\nseven tables; in 1780, he preached a whole day through and served seven\ntables. In Perthshire, Scotland, 2,361 persons at a communion service\nreceived the elements by way of twenty-nine tables.\n\nChurch officers appear to have been on the alert to see that no one -\nfailed to return their token and that none should be admitted without one.\nIn 1606 the records of the Stirling Kirk contain the following entry: \u201cThe\nAssembly ordains that all brothers within their bounds search diligently\nall the persons within their bounds that has absented himself from the\ncommunion the last time of the ministration thereof and to report their\nnames to the Session, that order may be had of them, seeing that it is\nfound that six score and three tokens delivered are not back again.\u201d The\nrecords of one small parish inform us that during the 18th Century their\nsession appointed two officers to collect at the gate, three to collect at the\ntent and six to \u201cwait at the church door and let no one enter the church\nbut those that hath tokens\u201d. It would appear, also, that the minister and\nelders exercised care in the distributing of tokens, not only to ensure that\nnone but members of the faith should be allowed to partake of \u2018the sacra-\nment, but also that the privilege might be withheld from anyone guilty of\nan unworthy act. It is recorded that at one communion service, a stranger\nwithout a token was found to be present. He was quietly removed for\nquestioning, but after satisfying the elders of his sincerity and good faith,\nwas allowed to return. Another church entry for October 5, 1800, reads:\n\u201cTwo members were censured for walking in a Masonic parade. Only one\nprofessed penitence and was given a token.\u201d Another, in 1836, tells us\nthat: \u201cMr. B... and his wife were reported living on no very amiable\nterms and were refused tokens. Before next communion they promised\nto forget their quarrels and live in harmony.\u201d A case is recorded in which\na minister from an adjoining parish was present during the examination of\nthose who wished to receive the sacrament at the next service. He recog-\nnized one applicant, a woman, and demanded that she be refused a token,\nclaiming that she was a witch. Later, she confessed that she was, and was\nburned.\n\nThe practice of selling tokens to ensure payment of church dues had\nthe disadvantage of leading to possible abuse and scandal. The actual\ndistribution of the tokens was usually entrusted to designated church offi-\ncers or members. One John Richardson of St. Margaret\u2019s Church, Dur-\nham, whose duty it was to distribute and collect the tokens, was charged\n\n\u2014 241 \u2014\n",
    "288": "with disturbing divine service during the dispensing of the sacrament at\nEaster by his irreverent manner of collecting tokens,\u2014 going up and\ndown among the communicants, demanding money and tokens from some\nwhose fees had already been paid for them by their masters or employers,\nand who had previously returned their tokens at the church door.\n\nAs with the bank and advertising tokens that are more familiar-to us,\nwe do not seem to have anything like a complete record of all the com-\nmunion tokens formerly in use. The Royal Scottish Museum catalogues\n717 distinct types, along with twenty stock dies from which an almost\nendless number of different token combinations could be produced. Alex-\nander J. S. Brodie described 1,161 different varieties, as well as a number of\ndoubtful origin, in use in Scotland up to the end of the 18th Century; he\nplanned to list and illustrate those which came into use in the 19th Cen-\ntury, but died suddenly in 1908 before this work was undertaken. While\ncommunion tokens seem to have been more closely associated with Scot-\nland than any other country in the early days, they were all used for the\nsame purpose: to identify the holder as one entitled and worthy to receive\nthe sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n\nScottish settlers and colonists were largely responsible for the subse-\nquent use of these tokens in many parts of the world, through the establish-\nment of their churches and schools wherever they settled in other lands.\nThey are more frequently found in the Maritime Provinces and Eastern\nCanada than in the West, because the Scottish settlers first established\nthemselves on our Atlantic seabord. Nevertheless, at least one Presbyte-\nrian church in, Winnipeg has several such pieces among its souvenirs of the\ndays when the Church of Scotland first arose in this great new land. They\nwere of all shapes and sizes, \u2014 usually about the size of a quarter or smaller.\nSome of the earlier ones were rather crudely cast, but the later varieties\nare square, oblong, round or oval in form, improving in design and work-\nmanship with the passage of time. Most of the early pieces had only ini-\ntials for the name of the parish or church, \u2014 some with a \u201cK\u201d for kirk or\n\u201cP\u201d for parish, others with the minister\u2019s initials (e.g. \u2014 in \u201cMr. I. M. K.\nA.\u201d, the \u201cI. M.\u201d represents the initials of the minister, Mr. Ian McIntyre,\n\u201cK\u201d stands for kirk, and \u201cA\u201d for the name of the parish, Amulree). In\ncertain cases one finds the full name or a contraction ther\u00e9of of the parish\nor church, although this seems to have been a later development. A num-\nber of the pieces are dated, though the practice did not become general\nuntil the 18th Century and undated tokens continued to appear at that\ntime. Most of them had a biblical text relating to the Lord\u2019s Supper or\na scriptural reference to it, and many had a design of some sort: the village\ncoat of arms, a bell, a bird, a tree, lily, burning lamp, stag\u2019s head, fish, and\nmany others.\n\nWhile a few communion tokens may still remain in use, the great\nmajority of them disappeared from circulation about one hundred years\n\n\u2014 42\n",

Favro)\n\n(Continued from November issue)\n\nNew Brunswick was ceded to Britain in 1763 by the \u2018Treaty of Paris,\nand was part of the colony of Nova Scotia till 1785, when it became a\nseparate colony. It continued to use the Spanish milled dollar as the\nbasis of currency, the rate being established at five shillings to the dollar.\n\nIn 1786, Act 26 George III, Cap. 16 laid down the following rates of\nexchange: Gold, Portuguese half-Johannes (or $8) \u00a32; British guinea\n\u00a31-3-4; Silver, British crown, 5/6; French 5 francs and Spanish dollar, 5/\u2014.\n\nIn 1805, another Act, 45 George III, Cap. 4, established new rates\nas follows: Gold, British guinea (5 dwt. 6 gr.) \u00a31-3-4; Portuguese Johannes\n(18 dwt.) \u00a34; Moidore (6 dwt. 18 gr.) \u00a31-10; Spanish doubloons (17 dwt.)\n\u00a33-14; French Louis d\u2019or before 1793 (5 dwt. 4 gr.) \u00a31-2-6; pistole 4 dwt.\n4 gr.) 18/\u2014; US. eagle (11 dwt. 6 gr.) \u00a32-10.\n\nIn 1816, the British coinage was reformed under Act 56 George III,\nCap. 68, and in 1820 New Brunswick revised its legislation accordingly\nby Act 60 George III, which was brought into effect by Order in Council\nin 1821. The sovereign contained 113 grains of fine gold, and was valued\nat \u00a31-2-3 currency, while the rates for other coins remained unchanged.\nAs the guinea still stood at \u00a31-3-4 currency, this meant that the sovereign\nwas circulating at a premium of 2/5. The United States dollar was rated\nat five shillings.\n\nAs a result of the undervaluation of British gold and because the\neagle rated 1/3 too high as compared with sterling, this was the only gold\ncoin to remain in circulation. New Brunswick had, in effect, adopted a\nUnited States standard for its coinage.\n\n\u2014 243 \u2014\n",
    "290": "In 1845, in an attempt to keep sterling in circulation, the legislature\npassed a bill setting the following rates of exchange: Sovereign \u00a31-4-2;\nEagle (after 1834) \u00a32-10; British Crown 6/042; French Ecu or 5 francs 5/6;\nDollar 5/\u2014. This Act, however, did not receive the Royal Assent.\n\nIn 1844, an even less satisfactory measure was passed, establishing the\nfollowing rates: Sovereign \u00a31-4; Eagle \u00a32-10; Crown 6/\u2014; Dollar-5/\u2014.\nThis still overvalued the eagle in relation to sterling by more than eight-\npence currency, or about 142 per cent, and thus effectively maintained its\npredominance.\n\nOn April 7, 1852, the New Brunswick legislature enacted 15 Victoria,\nCap. 85, whereby the use of dollars and cents was legalized in keeping\naccounts, although the unit of account was stated to be the \u201cpound\ncurrency\u201d. The Act also envisaged a local coinage, and established the\nfollowing rates of exchange: Sovereign \u00a31-4-4; Eagle \u00a32-10; Crown 6/1;\nShilling 1/2\u00a52. Although this statute valued sovereign and eagle more\naccurately in relation to each other, the eagle was still found more con-\nvenient in use, and the shilling was undervalued by a halfpenny.\n\nIn 1854, to avoid the necessity of importing more sovereigns, the\nProvince secured from the Royal Mint \u00a32,000 in pence and \u00a31,000 in half-\npence (480,000 of each) for local circulation.\n\nIn 1860, Act 23 Victoria, Cap. 48 revised the Act of 1852 by adopting\ndollars and cents for accounting, but permitted the use of a second column\nfor sterling.
